0,"Hi there,
I have just taken over an SLA room at RAF HWY in support of my Flexible Working agreement. Up until now I had been booking transit for each journey so I wanted to email and make sure my charges and claims were appropriate moving forward. I still own and live in my private residence when not at the office, so am I correct in thinking I do not then get charged for the SLA room? Having looked in JSP 752, I believe that instead of Manual HTD I would now instead be eligible for Get You Home Travel, which I believe is a daily rate rather than me submitting expense claims? I would be grateful if this could please be actioned from the 11 September 2024. My home address (which was used for the Manual HTD also) is approx. 140 miles from RAF High Wycombe.

DA contributes towards the additional costs incurred when moving to a new home. You are also entitled to Disturbance Leave, which allows you to take time off to settle into your new home. The leave can be taken in conjunction with other types of leave.

Many thanks in advance,","{'**Option 1:** If you send us your SFA retention document and confirmation from Henlows accommodation cell\r\nof your march in date and grade of SLA, we can then add the dual Accomodation waiver for your\r\nSLA.\r\nAs you have SLA, you will not be eligible for Home to Duty, however if your SFA is over 50 miles\r\naway from Henlow, you could look to claim for GYH.': 'human', '**Option 2:** Yes, you are correct that you will only need to pay for one set of accommodation, which will be your SFA in the Brize area. You will not be required to pay for the Sgt mess room at RAF Henlow. It is likely that this will happen automatically, but to confirm, you should notify the accommodation cell at Henlow and your Unit HR to ensure that your records are updated correctly. Having a room in the mess will indeed invalidate your entitlement to Home to Duty (HTD) or Get You Home (GYH) travel allowances, as you will have access to accommodation at your duty station. You will only be eligible for HTD or GYH if you are required to work late and cannot reasonably return to your SFA.': 'hierarchy', ""**Option 3:** Yes, you are correct that you will only need to pay for one set of accommodation, which will be the SFA in the Brize area.
