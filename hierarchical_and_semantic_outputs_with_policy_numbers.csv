0,"Hi there,
I have just taken over an SLA room at RAF HWY in support of my Flexible Working agreement. Up until now I had been booking transit for each journey so I wanted to email and make sure my charges and claims were appropriate moving forward. I still own and live in my private residence when not at the office, so am I correct in thinking I do not then get charged for the SLA room? Having looked in JSP 752, I believe that instead of Manual HTD I would now instead be eligible for Get You Home Travel, which I believe is a daily rate rather than me submitting expense claims? I would be grateful if this could please be actioned from the 11 September 2024. My home address (which was used for the Manual HTD also) is approx. 140 miles from RAF High Wycombe.
",You are correct that that as you own a private residence elsewhere you will not pay for accommodation (NB: Accommodation charges not dealt with in the 752). This change in accommodation does now entitle you to claim Get You Home. You will need to provide the documentary evidence (Could the Bot extract list  from 07.0405?)  and then submit a ticket on the HR Hub to have this actioned. ,"Yes, you are correct that you will not be charged for the SLA room as you own and live in your private residence when not at the office.","['d. The first day of commencement of a RW agreement.     07.0368. Effect on other allowances. SP claiming HDT from private accommodation are ineligible for concurrent payment of Get You Home (Travel) (GYH(T)).     07.0369. Effect of absences. The Allowances Absence Matrix in Chapter 2 Section 3 details the impact that distinct types of absence have on the eligibility for payment of HDT. This table should be consulted in all cases of absence to ensure that continued eligibility to HDT is appropriate.     Rates     07.0370. Rate Calculation. HDT rates and PC deductions for return journeys are shown in Chapter 3 Section 1 listed against the one-way journey distance.     Method of Claim     07.0371. HDT(Auto) is started, stopped or amended by the Arrivals Clerk via the Arrivals process.     07.0372 HDT(Man) is started, stopped or amended by the Arrivals Clerk via the Arrivals process. The SP must provide evidence of the costs associated with their standard HDT(Man) journey (e.g. rail fare) which are then entered on their HDT(Man) record in relation to the return journey.     07.0373. SP will be informed by the Arrivals Clerk of the total amount claimable for each HDT return journey and, if appropriate, the PC deduction they are to manually apply.     7 - 3 - 11 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     07.0374. SP must subsequently submit claims for HDT(Manual) no less than monthly in arrears via JPA Expenses. Claims are validated against their pre-recorded HDT(Man) details and are capped at the appropriate HDT distance (see paragraph 07.0376).     07.0375. Amended/Updated. To retain parity with HDT(Auto) payments SP must self- monitor the total miles driven per financial year. Once HDT(Man) journey claims exceed 10,000 miles per financial year SP must not claim for the return journey.     07.0376. HDT for personnel in receipt of Attendance Based Pay is started, stopped or amended by the Unit HR Administrator.     07.0377. SP without access to JPA should complete JPA Form F016 and pass it to Unit HR Admin staff for input to JPA.     07.0378. CFAV should complete JPA Form F016 and pass it to Unit HR Admin staff. Unit HR will check entitlement before sending claims to JPAC (Joint Personnel Administration Centre) for input to JPA.     07.0379. Passenger Allowance. Passenger allowance must be claimed manually via JPA as a separate Expense claim using Type of Claim = ‘Other Duty Travel’ under Expense Type = ‘Motor Mileage Allowance.’     Method of Payment     07.0380. Automated Payment. HDT (Auto) is paid monthly in arrears via salary. It is paid during annual leave and during any periods of less than 10 days when the SP does not travel to their Duty Station.     07.0381. HDT payments to SP in receipt of Attendance Based Pay are also paid in arrears via monthly pay.     07.0382. The SP’s statement of earnings will show the amount of HDT(Auto) paid and the PC deduction separately. However, SP who are eligible for HDT(Auto) but live in private accommodation less than nine miles from their Duty Station will not see HDT reflected in their statement of earnings.     07.0383. Manual Payments. HDT(Man) will be paid into the SP’s nominated bank account.     Annexes     A. Type of Season Ticket for Rail Travel     B.

The choice of which season ticket offers the best value for money depends upon the frequency of travel.     Season tickets are available for most short and medium distance journeys on the National Rail network. They are not available for long distance journeys but may be available where a train company chooses to offer them.     Type of ticket Validity Comments Daily On day of travel Only appropriate where there is     an infrequent requirement for travel     7-day/weekly Any consecutive seven days Cheaper than daily tickets when travelling three or more times a week     Flexi Travel on any eight days within a 28-day period     SP who regularly travel on more than two days per week will require more than one Flexi ticket per month     Carnet Usually six months but each train company sets their own terms and conditions     Pre-paid tickets (usually ten single or return journeys) which are useful when travelling on the same route but not regularly enough to buy a season ticket. They are not available on every route or for Advance or Off-Peak tickets.

Tube fares Yes     Rail fares Yes Advance, economy class     Congestion Charge     No Not admissible for HDT journeys. SP living in public accommodation within a Congestion Charging Zone may claim as per Chapter 8 Section 2.     Congestion Charge Registration Fee     No Not admissible for HDT journeys. SP living in public accommodation within a Congestion Charging Zone may claim as per Chapter 8 Section 2.     Congestion Charge Resident’s Fee     No Not admissible for HDT journeys. SP living in public accommodation within a Congestion Charging Zone may claim as per Chapter 8 Section 2.     Toll Charges Yes Not admissible for M6 toll.

Local conditions requiring additional mileage (e.g. the size of the Duty Station, where the route must go round an airfield/station perimeter for safety reasons or avoidance of notified out of bounds areas).     d. Longer routes which are shown to achieve a significantly reduced travelling time (for example by using a bypass) will be assessed on the longer route subject to the SP travelling on the longer route.     e. Claims for the M6 toll road are inadmissible for HDT journeys.     07.0318. HDT rates are paid per whole mile: 0.4 miles or less is rounded down, 0.5 miles or more is rounded up.     07.0319. Change of residence. If a SP changes RWA or AWA the HDT distance must be re-assessed and their HDT contribution amended accordingly.     6 Business Process Guide PR906001 – Home to Duty Travel Reservists – Attendance Based Pay.     7 The RN does not define nationally recruited reserves, the Unit CO may grant exceptional authority to allow MR personnel in their Unit to travel in excess of 50 miles. For the Army, this includes Nationally Recruited Reservists (‘Group A’ contracts – formerly known as Specialist Reservists) and other reservists who the unit CO considers key to unit capability. The CO must have written financial authority from the chain of command. For the RAF this includes Nationally Recruited Squadrons and Specialist Units defined in AP 3392 Vol 7 Part 2. In all cases, the CO must have written financial authority from the respective chain of command.     7 - 3 - 4 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     07.0320. Remote Working. SP who submit a Flexible Working Application for formal RW8 must record their intended AWA and working pattern on JPA (Joint Personnel Administration). Their HDT contribution will be assessed using the declared AWA.     07.0321. Remote Working overseas. Amended/Updated. There must be no expectation that SP who are undertaking voluntary RW overseas are eligible for any publicly funded allowances but see 07.0364 and 07.0365.     07.0322. Additional expenses. The following additional expenses are admissible as part of a HDT journey. See Annex B for further details about admissible expenses.     a. Economy class public transport season tickets (bus, rail and tube).     b. Regular, FTRS(FC) and personnel in receipt of ABP may claim actual road, tunnel and bridge tolls (except the M6 toll) when these are necessarily incurred on the most direct route. There must be no other reasonable alternative route or method of travel available for that part of the journey.     c. Toll fees may be claimed in isolation whether the SP lives under or over the relevant PC distance.     d. Ferry fares when necessarily incurred. There must be no other reasonable alternative route or method of travel available for that part of the journey.     e. Taxi fares and parking fees provided they are demonstrated to support the most cost effective means of travel.     07.0323. Congestion Charge, Ultra-Low Emission Zone and Clean Air Zones. Claims for additional expenses for driving in the Congestion Charge, Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) and Clean Air Zones (CAZ) within other towns and cities are not admissible as part of a HDT journey. The JPA option to claim Clean Air Zone Charges for HDT(Manual) journeys is not to be used pending its removal as soon as practicable.     07.0324. Public transport tickets. Working patterns for SP who are undertaking formal RW should be consistent over a reasonable period. For example, the RW agreement recorded on JPA could specify the number of working days per month which a SP is required to attend their Duty Station with attendance varying week by week within that overall total if required.     07.0325. SP are expected to plan their journeys in sufficient time to allow the most cost- effective public transport tickets to be purchased. The default should be Advance, standard class fares. Tickets should only be bought at the on-the-day, walk-up rate in exceptional circumstances – for example, where the SP has been ordered to return to their Duty Station immediately.     07.0326. Receipts. Receipts must be obtained and kept for all additional expenses for audit purposes.     8 See JSP750 – Centrally Determined Conditions of Service for details of how to apply for Remote Working.     7 - 3 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     07.0327. Car Share. Where SP at the same Duty Station travel together in the same private vehicle only the driver is eligible to claim HDT. The driver is eligible to claim passenger allowance for other SP(s) in the vehicle.     07.0328. Passenger Allowance. SP travelling by motor vehicle may claim passenger allowance subject to the following conditions:     a. The passenger(s) must be SP with an entitlement to HDT in their own right.     b. The passenger(s) must not claim HDT for journeys where passenger allowance is claimed on their behalf.     c. The journey claimed must be a reasonable route from the driver’s RWA or AWA to their shared Duty Station but consideration will be given on the selected route to take account of the passenger(s) pick-up and drop-off addresses.     07.0329. Personal Contribution (PC). The PC is the distance of travel that must be self-funded by SP. It is applied to each one-way journey.     07.0330. Eligible SP who travel farther than the relevant PC distance may claim HDT only for the additional mileage above the relevant PC distance and/or other additional expenses up to the appropriate limit.     07.0331. The relevant PC distance must not be rounded up to make a SP eligible for HDT.     07.0332. PC when living in Public Accommodation. SP living in public accommodation have little control over where they live in relation to their Duty Station. They self-fund the first three miles of HDT. Volunteer Reserve and Cadet Force Adult Volunteer (CFAV) also self-fund the first three miles9 even though they live in private accommodation.     07.0333. PC when living in Private Accommodation. SP living in private accommodation have more personal choice over where they live in relation to their Duty Station. They self-fund the first nine miles of HDT.     07.0334. PC for Bicycle claimants. SP who are claiming the bicycle rates for HDT self- fund the first one mile of HDT irrespective of accommodation type.     07.0335. PC deduction for HDT(Auto) payments. The PC is automatically deducted from monthly salary when HDT(Auto) is in payment. The deduction is set up by the Arrivals Clerk during the Arrivals process.     07.0336.

1,Please could you explain why I have got “25 days LSA” paid in my July pay statement on JPA?,"LSA would have been applied if the SP was not able to return to their parent unit at the weekends, or if they were classed as living in 'field conditions' for the duration of the course.  The alternative option is that LSA was applied incorrectly and GYH should have been issued (in my view, this is the likely course of events.) ","The payment of 25 days LSA in your July pay statement on JPA could be due to various reasons. It is possible that you have completed a 9-month deployment and are eligible for an uplift or supplement to your qualifying LSA service. At each 3-month point from a completed 9-month deployment, you will receive an additional 100 days qualifying service. This could have resulted in the payment of 25 days LSA in your July pay statement.","['Re-entering the Services.

Starting at the completion of a 9 month deployment, relevant adjustments to accumulated LSA totals are made every subsequent three months of continuous deployment e.g. at 12, 15 and 18 month points.     At each 3 month point from a completed 9 month deployment, the Service person will receive an additional 100 days qualifying service.     At each 3 month interval JPA F005 is to be raised by Unit HR.

A Service person who occupies an established post which has a continuing requirement for frequent, regular and repeated absence may be entitled to receive LSA OTR in accordance with paragraphs 10.0113 to 10.0116. In an effort to provide efficient administration for new OTR posts, and the review of existing posts, the following procedure is to be adopted:     a. At Appendix 1 is a proforma, which is to be used by unit HR admin staff when assessing a Service person’s initial and continuing entitlement to LSA OTR. The aim of this proforma is to ensure that all periods being used in assessing the eligibility for the payment of LSA OTR, are valid and relevant.     b. In assessing this eligibility, unit HR admin staff must count only full 24 hour periods of separation in excess of 4 days but less than 7 days spent away from the station, without the ability to return (e.g. 1000 hours 25 Jan 05 to 1200 hours 29 Jan 05 should not be interpreted as being eligible for a payment of 5 days LSA OTR, as it only equates to 98 hours and therefore may only be counted as 4 days).     c. Absence should be forecast 6 months in advance and applications for OTR status approval should be submitted in advance. The Service person must complete a minimum of 55 days absence on duty in each successive 6-month period throughout their tour of duty. Retrospective applications for OTR status may be submitted for consideration to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     d. LSA periods where absence from the permanent duty station is for 7 days or more bring entitlement to LSA in its own right and cannot therefore be counted towards LSA OTR (see paragraph 10.0115).     e. A copy of the relevant Job Description should be included with each application, detailing the requirement for regular travel away from the duty station in order to perform the duty, thereby supporting the OTR application. The Establishment number and the Service person’s Line Serial Number (LSN) on that establishment are to be included.     2. Submissions are to be made to the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.

In assessing this eligibility, unit HR admin staff must count only full 24 hour periods of separation in excess of 4 days but less than 7 days spent away from the station, without the ability to return (e.g. 1000 hours 25 Jan 05 to 1200 hours 29 Jan 05 should not be interpreted as being eligible for a payment of 5 days LSA OTR, as it only equates to 98 hours and therefore may only be counted as 4 days). \n \n c. Absence should be forecast 6 months in advance and applications for OTR status approval should be submitted in advance. The Service person must complete a minimum of 55 days absence on duty in each successive 6-month period throughout their tour of duty. Retrospective applications for OTR status may be submitted for consideration to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. \n \n d. LSA periods where absence from the permanent duty station is for 7 days or more bring entitlement to LSA in its own right and cannot therefore be counted towards LSA OTR (see paragraph 10.0115). \n \n e. A copy of the relevant Job Description should be included with each application, detailing the requirement for regular travel away from the duty station in order to perform the duty, thereby supporting the OTR application. The Establishment number and the Service person’s Line Serial Number (LSN) on that establishment are to be included. \n \n 2.

Requests for Service Accommodation must be made with the JSAU(L) welfare officer immediately on arrival in the UK or alternative overseas location. Refusal of allocated SFA (or equivalent) does not grant entitlement for PAR.     12.0613. Review of Accommodation Entitlement. There will be a review of SP in public accommodation led by DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC after 90 days from the date of evacuation (in conjunction with any review necessitated by paragraph 12.0629), in consultation with the evacuated Service personnel and their Unit HR. After the initial review, the likelihood of return is to be reviewed at monthly intervals. Accommodation charges for the area from which evacuated will only continue to be paid, and the UK accommodation charges waived, beyond 90 days after evacuation from the overseas area with the agreement of DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. At any point, in the event that a return is unlikely, the overseas accommodation charges will cease and the Service person will be liable for the appropriate UK, or different overseas location accommodation charges.

Subsistence. Service personnel may be eligible to claim subsistence expenses for initial accommodation arrangements in the UK, or alternative region, for each family member evacuated. Subsistence is payable for up to 30 nights from arrival if no other suitable accommodation arrangements are available. Subsistence is attributable for any service admin requirements (see Chapter 5 Sect 1). For those accommodated in SFA and privately rented accommodation, it is expected that self-catering facilities will be in place so no entitlement to subsistence exists.     12.0616. Disturbance Expenses (DE). SP and/or their immediate families may claim DE when evacuated to the UK or alternative location. DE will be paid at the rate appropriate to the type of accommodation being moved into. After a period not exceeding 90 days of claiming PAR, SP may claim DE when moving into public accommodation if it is still expected that SP will return to the overseas location. Those moving into the Services Cotswold Centre will be paid DE at the SLA Rate. The Child Element of DE may be claimed for any child(ren) who are evacuated and require changing school in accordance with Chapter 12 Section 1.     12.0617. Excess Accompanied Baggage. When travelling by commercial means and if space is available, eligible evacuated personnel may claim for any charge imposed for conveying 25kg Excess Baggage using an i-Expense Claim. One claim per Service Person and accompanying individual may be claimed.     12.0618. Travel Expenses. The cost of air travel as a direct result of evacuation will be met from public funds. Service personnel and, where applicable, their accompanying immediate family may claim reasonable travel expenses in accordance with Chapter 6, including taxi hire, for travel costs between the airport of arrival and their temporary accommodation. Return travel may also be claimed when return to the overseas duty station is subsequently authorised.

Evacuated SP are not eligibale for reverse SCV.     Is a Service person is unable to reunite with their child due to UK or Overseas travel restrictions or a mandatory period of self-isolation or quarantine, additional support such as travel and subsistence and accommodation cost for the period of restriction will be made available.

Overseas Loan Service Allowance (OLSA). Entitlement to OLSA ceases on the day before an evacuation is ordered. OLSA provides compensation for the unique local challenges faced by SP and their families serving in Loan Service (LS) appointments overseas. Payments of OLSA will remain in the event SP is not evacuated with their immediate family. In some specific circumstances the policy allows ongoing payment of OLSA when the SP is not in country. For example:     a. Evacuation while on authorised Leave. OLSA payment will cease once Service peronnel finish their period of leave following the issue of an evacuation order in the overseas duty location. Service Personnel are not to extend the period of leave while OLSA is in issue nor is leave to be authorised once known that an evacuation is imminent.     b. Evacuation while on Temporary Duty away from the Permanent Overseas Assignment. OLSA payment will continue until the end of the duty period after which OLSA will cease. OLSA payment will recommence the day after Service personnel returns to the overseas duty location.     c. Evacuation when on Medical Treatment outside the Evacuated Area. Service Personnel who are in receipt of medical treatment outside of the evacuated location will continue to receive OLSA except periods of terminal or invaliding leave granted on the termination of the qualifying assignment.     12.0621. Get You Home (Overseas) (GYH(O)). Service personnel evacuated from the permanent overseas area will not be entitled to claim any unused GYH(O) unless they are evacuated to another Overseas Location. The GYH(O) entitlement will be the rate in the new overseas location.

Service personnel who change rank are to receive the allowance at the rate appropriate to their new rank from the date on which they draw the pay of that rank, irrespective of the date of notification. \n \n 05.0316. Review Procedure. COs are to review those in receipt of LA every 6 months in order to verify entitlement. In particular, the CO is required to certify that the Service person could not be accommodated in suitable SLA or, if married or in a civil partnership, travel daily from the place where their immediate family is residing. If SLA is available or daily travel is possible the Service person should move as soon as possible and LA should be stopped. \n \n 05.0317. Duration of Allowance. In certain circumstances LA may be approved for more than 6 months, but will not normally remain in issue for a period exceeding 3 years (e.g. unforeseen extension(s) of duty). COs are to forward details of cases that are likely to exceed 3 years to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC seeking approval for continued payment beyond the third anniversary of the date for which payment was first issued. This action should be taken well in advance of the expiry of the 3-year point to enable sufficient time for consideration by DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC and communication back to the unit. \n \n 05.0318.

Claimants who are temporarily absent from their duty station for a period of up to and including 61 days, will continue to receive the allowance in respect of their lodgings provided they retain, pay for and do not sublet their lodgings, and furnish a certificate to that effect. However, where COs are satisfied that exceptional short term circumstances lead to the period exceeding 61 days (e.g. hospitalisation), they will authorise continued payment.

The aim of Refund of Legal Expenses (RLE) is to contribute towards the legal and associated expenses a Service person necessarily incurs when on assignment they elect to both sell a Residence at Work Address (RWA) and purchase a RWA at the new duty station. Alternatively, it contributes towards the legal fees that arise on letting and repossession of a home (see Section 3 Part 2). It therefore assists existing homeowners to remain in the property market.     12.0302. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Section 271 to 287 refunds of expenses incurred in respect of the sale and purchase of residences are non-taxable. Refunds of legal fees in respect of letting and repossession are liable to tax and NICs; these are met by the MOD and paid by DBS under PSA.     Definitions     12.0303. Qualifying Assignment. A Qualifying Assignment is one for which a Service person is in possession of a permanent assignment order requiring them to move to a new duty station, which clearly indicates a likelihood of serving a minimum of 12 months at the new duty station. For RLE Letting a Qualifying Assignment is one which clearly indicates that the Service Person is likely to serve at least 6 months (182 days) at the new duty station.     12.0304. Commuting Distance. For the purposes of these regulations, the acceptable commuting distance is defined as being within 50 miles of the duty station or, if over 50 miles, within 90 minutes’ travelling time by public transport.     12.0305. Qualifying Residence. For the purpose of these regulations a qualifying residence is defined as being a static home (e.g.house, flat, maisonette, bungalow or mobile home). Houseboats, caravans and dedicated business premises (but see paragraph 12.0313) are not qualifying residences.     For the purposes of Remote Working (RW), RLE may only be claimed for an Alternative Work Address (AWA) where the residence is also the Service Persons RWA.     12.0306. Qualifying Moves. A Qualifying Move is one in which the sale and purchase or the letting of the residence is as a direct consequence of an assignment to a new permanent duty station that entitles the Service person and, if appropriate, their immediate family, to move at public expense     a.

General Conditions for Sale and Purchase of a RWA and Letting of a RWA     12.0307 RWA. A RWA, or former RWA, is defined as a property that is occupied, or has been occupied, by the Service person for a minimum period of 6 months either at the present duty station or a previous duty station.     12.0308. Claims. RLE against one property, either for sale/purchase or letting, per qualifying assignment is permissible to be claimed.     12.0309. Reserve Forces. For the purposes of this Section, Reserve Forces refers only to Full Time Reserve Service (Full Commitment) (FTRS(FC)) personnel who are required, for Service reasons, to relocate in mid-commitment, and are able to satisfy the length of employment conditions within these regulations. (Although Army Reserve NRPS, FTRS (Limited Commitment) (FTRS(LC)), FTRS (Home Commitment) (FTRS(HC)) and Additional Duties Commitment (ADC) may be eligible exceptionally to claim refund of legal expenses if they are invited to be assigned to a new duty station and have to move house in the interests of the Service and when authorised by the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC).     12.0310.

The aim of Disturbance Expense (DE) is to contribute towards the necessary additional expenses that may arise when the Services require their personnel to make a qualifying move to or from a RWA on permanent assignment. \n \n 12.0102. Scope. DE applies for moves within the UK, between the UK and overseas, overseas and UK or moves between overseas stations. Expenditure associated with moving from one residence to another varies from move to move. The expenses (see Annex A to this Section) that underpin the DE rates are kept under constant review to ensure the rates cover expenses incurred in the majority of moves. Some SP will find that the expenses incurred in connection with a particular move will be higher than the allowance paid, while for other moves expenses will be lower. Over the course of a full career, therefore, DE will have made a significant contribution towards costs incurred. \n \n 12.0103. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Section 271 to 287 elements of DE are taxable. Where required, tax and NICs will be met by MOD and paid by DBS under a PSA for: \n \n a. Mid-assignment moves for Service reasons within the UK. \n \n b. Final Tour of Duty moves within the UK (see Section 5 of this Chapter). \n \n c.

The following conditions apply:     a. The Service person must be in possession of an Assignment Order which clearly states that there is a likelihood of serving a minimum of 6 months (182 days) full time service at the new duty station from the latest of the following dates:     12 - 3 - 8 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     (1) The effective date of the start of the new assignment; or     (2) The date of joining the new duty station.     12.0332. Right of Possession. Service home owners who let their RWA rather than reclaiming their sale and purchase costs in the UK as a direct consequence of a new assignment are strongly advised, if they wish to re-occupy the residence, to establish a right of repossession on the termination of the tenancy (subject, if necessary, to any legal process). This is achieved by having an appropriate tenancy agreement drawn up, and by service of the requisite legal notices to the prospective tenants.     12.0333. Correct Legal Documentation. A right of repossession can only be safeguarded by correct application of the relevant legislation before the property is let. Service personnel should employ the services of a solicitor (or Scottish equivalent) in drawing up the appropriate tenancy agreement, which must be compliant with the Housing Act 1988 or any subsequent Act. Failure to observe these requirements may nullify any claims for refund of residence letting-tenancy fees or costs. It is emphasised that if the tenancy agreement is drawn up by a qualifying authority, such as an estate agent or property services agency, instead of a solicitor, it will be at the claimant’s own risk. In such circumstances should disputes or difficulties arise with either the agent or tenant when repossessing the property there will be no entitlement to a refund of any extra costs which result from not using a solicitor to draw up the original qualifying agreement.     Eligibility for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0334. Eligible Service Personnel. Subject to the following conditions, Regular and Reserve Service (see paragraph 12.0309) personnel making a qualifying move that results in them wishing to let their property may receive a refund of legal expenses as specified in paragraphs 12.0343 to 12.0344.     Ineligibility for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0335. Joint Ownership Expenses. Service personnel are not eligible to claim a refund of tenancy letting costs for expenses that have, or will be, claimed by a joint owner from any other source. They may, however, receive reasonable refunds for up to the value of the allowable expenses that have not been, and will not be, claimed by any other joint owner(s).     12.0336 Non-Residential Use. If any part of the property is, or will be, used for other than purely residential letting purposes, (e.g.a farm, boarding house or shop), RLE Letting expenses may not be claimed.     Conditions for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0337. Length of Occupation of Property. The property being let must have been a RWA, and the Service person must normally have occupied the property for at least a 6- month period during an assignment.     12.0338. Property Ownership.

Service Joint Ownership. If the property is owned by more than one Service person, the refunds will be divided by the number of Service owners who meet all the other qualifying conditions and paid only to them.     12.0341. Restrictions on Sale.

Aim. The aim of Insurance Allowance (IA) is to meet the average cost of transit insurance purchased by Service personnel when they are required to move their Personal Effects (PE) for Service reasons, but are not entitled to claim Disturbance Expenses.     12.0202. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). IA is liable to Income Tax and NICS in respect of assignments, temporary assignments or deployments within the UK. The tax and NICS will be met by MOD and paid by DBS under PSA. In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Section 299 IA is non-taxable for Service personnel assigned, temporarily assigned, or deployed outside the UK.     Eligibility     12.0203. Eligible Service Personnel. All Service personnel who are entitled to move their PE using Unaccompanied Baggage (UB) (see Section 4 of this Chapter) or unit arranged moves on deployment or assignment, but are ineligible to claim DE for the move, are eligible to claim IA.     Ineligibility     12.0204. Ineligible Service Personnel. Those Service personnel who have received DE for a particular move are ineligible for IA for the same move.     Entitlement     12.0205. General. Eligible Service personnel are entitled to a payment of IA if they have purchased insurance to cover their PE in transit. Refund of the actual cost may be paid, up to the maximum IA rate. However, individuals may not draw IA in respect of the same operational deployment and therefore it is expected that only one IA claim may be made within a 12 month period.     Documentation     12.0206. Supporting Evidence. Service personnel are required to retain, for 24 months, supporting evidence of the purchase and cost of the transit insurance cover to the full value of their PE. Where this is included in a household insurance policy, it should be shown separately within the schedule.     Rates     12.0207. Method of Rate Calculation.

12.0420. Private Move Arrangements – UK Private Arrangements Self-Help Scheme (UKPASH). This
scheme does not involve the GRMS or MOD contractors. SP may make private removal arrangements
within the UK instead of using FMS, RSO, and SPS, and claim the costs incurred, subject to the criteria
provided below:
a. SP are responsible for making their own arrangements using a commercial carrier or self-drive
vehicle/trailer for the private move. The PE will be moved at the SP’s own risk and should be fully insured
by them. The MOD will not be liable for
any loss, damage, or delay. The maximum amount that can be claimed is the lower of:
(1) The current UKPASH rate (as detailed in Chapter 3 Section 1) multiplied by the volume of PE moved
up to a maximum of 6 CuM regardless of any higher entitlement elsewhere within this section; or

(2) The receipted actual cost for the volume of PE moved.
b. All claims for UKPASH must be supported by copies of receipted invoices in the name of the SP. If a
private motor vehicle is used, claims will be paid at the Motor Mileage Allowance (MMA) rates plus
additional expenses incurred, such as packaging and vehicle or trailer hire. Additional MMA claims for
travel on assignment cannot be submitted for the same journey. Only one UKPASH consignment per
assignment is permitted14. Applications must be pre-approved by unit HR admin staff using the form at
Annex B of this Section","Yes, you can find guidance on using the UKPASH system in Chapter 12 of JSP 752. It provides information on the UK Private Arrangements Self-Help Scheme, including how to make private removal arrangements, claim costs, and the criteria for using the scheme.","[""Charges for PE that remain in storage beyond these time frames will be recovered from the SP’s salary.     12.0428. Excess Baggage. SP are only entitled to move the volumes stated in this JSP; there is no entitlement to move excess baggage under the terms of the MOD contract. Where the contract surveyor estimates that there is a small ‘excess’ (less than     12 - 4 - 14 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     15% above entitlement), a SP will be able to move that excess volume with the remainder of their entitled consignment, but the cost of the excess, calculated by the MOD Contractor, will be recovered from the SPs salary. If the excess is above 15% the SP must enter into a private agreement with a contractor of their choice as per 12.0407b.     12.0429. Cancellation Charge/Wasted Journeys. SP who need to cancel the collection or delivery of their PE are to give the Unaccompanied Baggage Manager (UBM) a minimum of 2 working days’ notice by telephone, followed immediately by notice in writing, either by fax, email or letter, and must ensure that receipt is confirmed16. Failure to provide this notice will result in charges being passed to the SP. A Wasted Journey Charge is applied when the UBM does not receive any notification and is unable to make a collection or delivery owing to the non-attendance of the SP or their nominated representative. Waiver of such charges, where they were incurred for Service reasons, may only be granted by DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0430. Responsibility for charges. The responsibility for payment of charges is as follows;     a. The SP is responsible for payment of any customs duties on their PE.     b. The SP is responsible for all charges incurred in cases such as returning PE to units due to incorrect documentation, inclusion of prohibited items, exceeding weight or dimension restrictions, or failure to follow guidance provided by the UBM. If the SP is unavailable to pay the bill immediately, it will become an excess charge and be deducted from their salary. The MOD is responsible for the cost of one complete movement of PE within entitlement and any repeated movements due to the reasons mentioned above will be the responsibility of the SP.     c. If a delay occurs in the move of a SP whose unaccompanied PE has already been dispatched to their next duty station, unit HR admin staff may seek authorisation from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC to return the necessary PE. Return of PE requires prior authorisation from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC, who will decide responsibility for payment of all charges.     12.0431 Heavy or oversized items. All items within a PE consignment should be manageable by a two person lift without the need for specialist equipment. If a SP has particularly bulky, heavy, or specialised items, they should notify the contractor early in the application process and before the survey. During the survey, the SP will be informed whether the heavy or oversized items can be moved within the contract's scope or if the SP needs to arrange a private contract for their removal. The costs of the private contract will not be covered by the MOD.     Rates     12.0432. Methods of rate calculation. Rates are calculated based on CuM entitlement from Annex A.

Normally only one consignment may be moved and Service personnel are not entitled to publicly funded storage. The CuM rate is based upon the average household move and capacity of a standard removal lorry. This is reviewed each time the contract is renegotiated by GRMS.     2. RSO (see paragraph 12.0419b).

"", ""Alternatively, they may move their items from storage in the UK to the FMS country, providing the combined volume of the RSO move and move from storage do not exceed the maximum volume allowed under the FMS.     c. The Self Pack Service (SPS). The SPS is primarily intended for use by single non-homeowners and unaccompanied personnel moving to or from a RWA in the UK or overseas. It consists of one consignment only.     (1) Married accompanied SP moving in advance of their immediate family may use SPS in conjunction with the RSO or FMS, but the volume moved under SPS will count towards the overall entitlement. The SPS can also be used in conjunction with RSO to minimise the inconvenience of long transit times.     (2) Married unaccompanied personnel assigned to a new overseas duty station, where they will be joined by their family, may use the SPS but this will form part of the overall RSO/FMS PE entitlement for the family.     12 - 4 - 10 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     (3) Under the SPS, SP are responsible for obtaining packing materials from unit supply, and for the packing and unpacking of their PE. The Contractor, or military supply system where appropriate, will arrange transportation.     (4) SP deploying on Operational Tours are not entitled to ship any effects overseas through utilisation of the SPS contract (but see paragraph 12.0422).     d. Deferred Delivery. SP who are assigned between two overseas locations may request deferred delivery of PE for up to three months from the date of collection from the first overseas assignment, to allow time for suitable accommodation to be found in the second location. Any extensions beyond 3 months must be authorised by the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0420. Private Move Arrangements – UK Private Arrangements Self-Help Scheme (UKPASH). This scheme does not involve the GRMS or MOD contractors. SP may make private removal arrangements within the UK instead of using FMS, RSO, and SPS, and claim the costs incurred, subject to the criteria provided below:     a. SP are responsible for making their own arrangements using a commercial carrier or self-drive vehicle/trailer for the private move. The PE will be moved at the SP’s own risk and should be fully insured by them. The MOD will not be liable for any loss, damage, or delay. The maximum amount that can be claimed is the lower of:     (1) The current UKPASH rate (as detailed in Chapter 3 Section 1) multiplied by the volume of PE moved up to a maximum of 6 CuM regardless of any higher entitlement elsewhere within this section; or     (2) The receipted actual cost for the volume of PE moved.     b. All claims for UKPASH must be supported by copies of receipted invoices in the name of the SP. If a private motor vehicle is used, claims will be paid at the Motor Mileage Allowance (MMA) rates plus additional expenses incurred, such as packaging and vehicle or trailer hire. Additional MMA claims for travel on assignment cannot be submitted for the same journey. Only one UKPASH consignment per assignment is permitted14. Applications must be pre-approved by unit HR admin staff using the form at Annex B of this Section.     Storage of PE     12.0421. General. PE may be stored at public expense when using the RSO or when required to occupy tied SFA in the UK (as per 12.0412f). Single homeowners or householders are entitled to storage when assigned overseas, but only if their privately owned or rented property is being used as a RWA or is a Privately Maintained Property (as defined at Para 02.0137) for which they have been claiming GYH(T).     14 A consignment is the amount of goods to be moved, up to the entitled maximum, for which multiple journeys can be authorised, within Annex B, if required.     12 - 4 - 11 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     a. Storage is limited to 67.92 CuM minus the total volume of PE moved to the overseas duty station or tied SFA within the UK. The total combined volume of PE moved and stored must not exceed 67.92 CuM.     b. Entitlement to storage at public expense begins 14 days prior to the date of embarkation and concludes 28 days after the official date of return to the UK on completion of an overseas assignment. Personnel who exceed the 28 day entitlement are responsible for the storage costs themselves, with charges starting from day 29. Entitlement to the costs of packaging and transport will remain as per Para 12.0412.     c. If SP receive a subsequent overseas assignment, then entitlement to storage continues until assigned back to the UK or on termination of service. On assignment SP may add or remove PE to or from store provided they stay within their total movement of PE and storage entitlements.     d. SP are entitled to remove their full PE from storage mid assignment but there will be no further entitlement to storage until a new assignment is received. This does not give entitlement to other allowances.     e. During an assignment, travel costs and access to stored items will not be funded at public expense.     f. SP returning to the UK for periods of leave or training courses between consecutive overseas assignments may continue to store their PE at public expense for up to 3 months.     g. When an assignment is cancelled and PE is already consigned to storage, it may continue to be stored for a period of 28 days from date of notification of a cancelled assignment.     h. When a SP’s spouse/civil partner returns to the UK and occupies a permanent residence ahead of the service person, entitlement to storage at public expense will cease 28 days after the spouse/civil partner's return. This move of PE to the permanent residence will be considered as the ‘on assignment move’. However, if the spouse/civil partner returns to temporary accommodation then entitlement to storage is retained until 28 days after the return of the SP on assignment.     i. SP utilising storage for their PE when moving into a Tied SFA on Virtue of Appointment are entitled to commence storage from the date of occupation of the Tied SFA until the date of march-out.     j. For remote working purposes, Service couples should read paragraph 02.0146 to understand where the eligibility lies for the Storage of PE.     12.0422. Operational Tours (not maritime deployments). When single SP residing in public accommodation are assigned on operations their PE may be stored at public expense up to a maximum of 6 CuM. Storage must initially be sought within unit storage prior to application for storage at public expense.

future move, you will be able to claim GYH at your next unit.
You may retain eligibility to Disturbance Expense and movements of personal effects at public
expense within 6 months of reporting for duty, with at least a further 6 months to serve at the
current duty station.
The circumstances are specific, so I recommend that you read these in full in JSP 752 Chapter 12,
Section 4, Paragraph 12 (12.0412) so you are confident that you meet the entitlement for your
situation.","Yes, you are correct in assuming you would be entitled to Get You Home (GYH) travel allowance. Since you will be keeping your SFA at Shawbury but living in SLA at Marham, you can claim GYH travel to visit your family at Shawbury. For Disturbance Expense (DE), it is recommended that you delay putting in your claim until you have moved into your SFA at Marham. This is because DE is intended to cover the costs associated with setting up a new home, and claiming it when you move into SLA might not be applicable. There is no specific time limit to claim DE after posting, but it's generally recommended to claim it within a reasonable timeframe, usually within 6-12 months of the move.","[""Eligible Service Personnel. EMS only applies, and may only be awarded, to Service personnel in PStat Cat 1 and 2 who are moving to serve accompanied at a RWA (SFA or privately owned or rented families accommodation) at the new duty station. EMS relocations may then occur within 12 months of the expected Unit move date. Units are to ensure that individuals who will have less than 6 months to serve at the new location have the option to be relocated straight to their subsequent duty station elsewhere, or retain SFA at their current duty station, to avoid a double move wherever possible.     12.0803. Personnel Assigned to a Relocating Unit. EMS may be granted to eligible personnel who are assigned to join a Unit that is due to relocate, enabling them to move their family direct to a RWA at the intended new duty station in order to avoid a double move. Individuals also have the option to apply to retain SFA at their current duty station for up to 11 months before then moving to the new duty station, in accordance with JSP 464 Chapter 8. This is also to avoid a double move.     12.0804. SFA/SLA Considerations. For those intending to move into a new RWA that is SFA, EMS may only be granted when SFA is available at the new duty station location. EMS may also only be granted when SLA is available at the current duty station for the Service person to occupy after the family has relocated under EMS.     12.0805. Application Procedure. Following consultation with DE Ops Housing (or other housing provider if overseas) and IPG, Units are to apply, through their chain of command, to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC in accordance paragraph 04.0402, for authority to grant EMS to their Service personnel. A full and detailed justification is to be provided. Once PACCC have granted approval, Units must carefully prioritize the EMS relocations of their personnel, in close consultation with both DE Ops Housing and IPG, in order to achieve a gradual transition that matches available resources.     Entitlement     12.0806. Relocation Package. Individuals granted written approval of EMS by their Units are then able to apply for SFA and the appropriate relocation package and Disturbance Expenses as defined in JSP 752 Chapter 12.     12 - 8 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     12.0807. Separation. Individuals separated under EMS may apply for separation allowances as follows;     a. LSA. Individuals who relocate their families to a different Theatre under EMS are to be treated as VOLSEP for the purpose of LSA, and are entitled to claim LSA at Level 1 in accordance with Chapter 10 Section 1. LSA may not be claimed simultaneously with GYH(T).     b. GYH Travel. Individuals who relocate their families within the same country, having undertaken a relocation under EMS may claim GYH Travel, however this may not be claimed simultaneously with LSA.     12.0808. Accommodation Charges. Individuals who are separated from their families having undertaken an early relocation under EMS, and who are then accommodated within SLA, will be exempt from SLA charges.     12.0809. LOA. When an EMS relocation is effected from an overseas location to the UK, any LOA entitlement will reduce to the Married Unaccompanied rate.     12.0810. CEA. Where an individual is a CEA claimant, applications for EMS must be considered on their own merits in every instance. Casework is to be submitted by individuals to the PACCC in accordance with paragraph 04.0402. Where EMS is subsequently awarded to a CEA claimant, the claimant will be deemed to be INVOLSEP for the purpose of CEA only. (12.0813 also applies).     12.0811. Late Movers. The immediate family must move to join the Service person at the new duty station as soon as possible. Where the immediate family remain in the former duty station because of a lack of transport facilities, or the competent medical authority has certified that a member of their immediate family is unfit to travel, or because they are retaining SFA under the provisions of JSP 464, Part 1, Chapter 8, the Service person will be entitled to the following;     a. LSA or GYH Travel. As described at para 12.0807.     b. Accommodation Charges. As described at para 12.0808.     c. LOA. Where the immediate family remains at the former duty station in an LOA area, the appropriate Residual rate of LOA will remain payable from the date of the Service person's departure until the earliest date they can be rejoined by their immediate family, or until their immediate family leave the LOA area, whichever is the sooner.     d. CEA. As described at para 12.0810.     e. The Service person will be deemed VOLSEP for all allowances when any of the following circumstances apply;     (1) When the Service person refuses to accept an offer of SFA, appropriate to rank and family size.     (2) When the arrival date of the family at the RWA at the new duty station is delayed through personal choice, beyond the date of the Unit relocation.     12 - 8 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     In all of the circumstances outlined in 12.0811e above, VOLSEP will apply from the date of allocation of the (refused) SFA, or the Service person’s arrival date at the new duty station, whichever is the later.     12.0812. Change of Assignment. Where the individual, having undertaken an EMS relocation, is then subsequently required to accept a different assignment, either at a new location or within a shorter timescale than previously anticipated, they will then be eligible for a further relocation package at public expense. Units are to ensure that close liaison is maintained with Career Managers prior to granting EMS to avoid the costs and domestic instability generated by a double move.     12.0813. Cessation of Early Mover Status. Allowances granted under the EMS will cease the day the Service person and family are reunited at the RWA at the new duty station. Normal entitlements will then apply. "", 'Child Element. The Child Element of DE contributes towards the additional costs5 faced by Service parents when their child(ren) are required to change school as a direct result of the SP being permanently assigned to a new duty station. SP entitled to DE may claim the Child Element for each child (as defined at 02.0110) who is receiving full-time education, which includes nursery school or technical college. The following conditions must also be met to be eligible to claim the Child Element of DE6 :     a. The SP must be recorded as PSTAT Cat 1 or 2 and have declared their children on JPA.     4 This includes the immediate issue of a Medical Pension on discharge.     5 Costs include buying new school uniform or clothing and associated items when moving a child from one school, or place of apprenticeship, to another.     6 For determination of entitlement in exceptional circumstances casework should be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12 - 1 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. The SP must be eligible for the SFA / SSSFA / Privately Owned/Rented rate of DE. SP claiming the SLA rate of DE will not ordinarily be eligible for the Child Element of DE.     c. Any nursery school or playgroup is to be established under formal arrangements with the Local Education Authority (LEA) or equivalent overseas.     12.0116. Delayed Moves. The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense and DE where there is a clear intent to move on assignment. Delayed moves resulting in an entitlement to DE are as per paragraph 12.0412. SP who move into SLA on a temporary basis while arranging permanent accommodation may defer the payment of DE until they move into their selected permanent accommodation and therefore claim the appropriate rate (see paragraph 12.0114). DE may not be claimed for both moves. Delayed moves for any other reason may be authorised by DBS MIL PERS- MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0117. Mid-assignment Moves. The following rules apply for entitlement to DE on mid-assignment moves:     a. DE is payable for mid-assignment moves where a move of accommodation is directed by DIO, or equivalents, or for Service reasons7. Where there are compelling welfare, medical or compassionate reasons for a mid-assignment move approval should be sought from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The CO or authorising officer should stipulate whether the case requires urgent resolution or not.     b. Where the SP accommodation entitlement changes due to promotion or a change in the size of the immediate family (other than as a result of first setting up of home as per 12.0107c) the SP will normally be entitled to a mid-assignment move and therefore the associated level of DE. The SP must have an expectation of occupying the new property for at least 6 months.     c. Mid-assignment moves for other personal reasons, including on estrangement, and for operational deployments do not give an entitlement to DE.     d. Mid-assignment moves to or from an AWA do not give an entitlement to DE unless the SP has been ordered to in writing or the conditions in sub para a. above have been met.     12.0118. House Moves on Security Grounds. Any requirement for SP to move home as a result of a security threat, which has been verified by a Home Department Police Force, is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. Such SP are entitled to Disturbance Expenses, Refund of Legal Expenses and Movement and Storage of Personal Effects allowances and may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred.     a. For Mainland UK moves, CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is at Chapter 12, Section 4.     7 Mid-Assignment Moves between SLA should be of a permanent nature i.e. for a minimum of a 6 month period as stated in Para 12.0114.     12 - 1 - 6 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. For Northern Ireland moves, Comd 38 (Irish) Brigade is responsible for authorising all claims, having consulted with CDP(AF Rem) staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is contained within 38 (Irish) Brigade Standing Instructions (NISO 119).     12.0119. Service Couples. Where a Service couple occupy the same private accommodation (owned or rented) or SFA/SSFA, only one individual is eligible to claim DE for that accommodation. This is normally the individual who is recognised as PStat Cat 1s.     12.0120. SP Sharing Private Accommodation. Where a SP entitled to DE moves into shared private accommodation with other SP, who are not their spouse or civil partner, the rate of the allowance payable will be as follows:     a. When sharing with one other SP, who is entitled to claim DE for the move, on occupying the accommodation half the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     b. When sharing with 2 or more other SP, who are entitled to claim DE, on occupying the accommodation one third of the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     12.0121. Families of Deceased SP. Following the death of a SP, their immediate family is entitled to DE for any move between Service accommodation and for their final move from Service accommodation into private accommodation.     12.0122. Evacuated Families. For entitlement to DE as a consequence of emergency evacuation from an overseas assignment, see Section 6 to this Chapter.     Rates     12.0123. Method of Rate Calculation. The rates are based upon the average additional expenditure incurred when SP are required to move into a RWA at a new duty station in the UK or overseas. MOD then determines the type of expenditure it will support (e.g. at present it will support the cost of providing new school uniforms; but it will not support the loss of income as a result of a spouse/civil partner or partner giving up their employment). The full list of items to which DE currently contributes is at Annex A to this Section.     12.0124. Publication of Rates of DE. The rates of DE will be published in the annual CDP Rem Directed Letter “Rates of Entitlement for Allowances for SP”. The current rates are also at Chapter 3 Section 1.     Method of Claim     12.0125. Method of Claim. Claims for DE may be submitted 45 days prior to the expected move date. Service personnel are to claim using the JPA on-line self-service system. ', ""Where a SP successfully applies to occupy surplus SFA on assignment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, Chapter 9, DE will be paid at the SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate; this does not confer entitlement to any other relocation allowances unless mentioned within the specific chapters. The SP     3 A move to a seagoing unit where policy prevents SP from being accommodated onboard and therefore SP will be accommodated in SLA, is a qualifying move.     12 - 1 - 3 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     will not be eligible to claim further DE should they be required to vacate the surplus SFA in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, paragraph 0905.     e. Where a SP is required to be accommodated in appropriated SFA in lieu of SLA (IAW JSP 464 Vol 2 Pt 1 para 0209), DE will be paid at the SLA rate unless they are also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a).     12.0109. Service Couples (as per definition at 02.0205). A PStat Cat 1(s) or (c) SP, whose authorised change of PStat Cat was effected at the time of the new assignment, may claim DE provided a claim, other than at the SLA rate, has not been made by either of the partners in the previous 182 days. For determination of entitlement in exceptional circumstances (e.g. short notice change of assignment) casework should be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0110. Qualifying Periods. There is no entitlement to DE for moves solely as a consequence of a temporary assignment (as defined in 02.0107) except in the following circumstances:     a. A family move to a residence, which is to be occupied during 2 or more assignments or courses (which may be at different places) provided the total period of occupation is expected to exceed 182 days.     b. SP returning from an overseas assignment when leaving the Services and with an expectation of at least 91 days service (this period includes resettlement courses and terminal absence) from the date of arrival in the UK. Where it can be demonstrated that the 91 days qualifying period cannot be achieved for Service reasons a case is to be made to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0111. Cancelled Assignment. A SP whose Assignment Order is cancelled and who has necessarily incurred expenses in anticipation of a qualifying move, may submit a claim for these expenses to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The total claim must not exceed the appropriate rate of DE and any Child Element (see paragraph 12.0115). Only items of expenditure which the allowance was devised to cover (see Annex A to this Section) will be admissible and receipts must be provided. If the full entitlement to DE has been claimed prior to notification of the cancellation receipted actual costs incurred should be included in casework submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0112. Medical Discharges. SP will be eligible for DE on medical discharge under the following circumstances:     a. They have been awarded a Joint Medical Employment Standard (JMES) of Permanent, Medically Non-Deployable by their Service Employment Board with a Medical Employment Standard of A5/L6/M6/E5, ie unfit to be taken into the air, unfit for land or maritime environments and may be employed within the UK only. This includes Army personnel who are medically discharged under Medical Employment Standard L5, who were not made an employment offer. A code that indicates fit for service in a functional area that is not linked to the Service person's own Service is acceptable, eg a sailor graded L5. (For further information on JMES see JSP 950, Vol 6, Ch 7).     12 - 1 - 4 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. SP who are discharged from the Services on medical grounds, and who will be in receipt of an Immediate Pension4 or Early Departure Payment, may be entitled to the benefits of the Final Tour of Duty Provision (see 12.0505g to this Chapter).     12.0113. Personnel Transferring Between the Services. Where a SP transfers from one Service to another, with no break between the 2 periods of service, this will be treated as an assignment for DE purposes and will be payable if they are otherwise eligible.     Entitlement     12.0114. General. Only one claim and therefore one rate of DE is payable when a SP is permanently assigned to a new duty station (but see paragraph 12.0117), including the Child Element of DE where appropriate. The DE payment is to be based upon the type of accommodation the Service person is going to occupy and whether it is in the UK or overseas. The property for which DE is claimed must be occupied for a minimum of 6 months during the assignment. In cases where the accommodation for which a DE payment is made is vacated within 6 months for other than Service reasons recovery action will be taken. Rates payable are for moves into:     a. SFA or Privately Owned or Rented Accommodation. This rate is payable to SP who occupy either SFA (except see paragraph 12.0114b) or Substitute Service Families’ Accommodation (SSFA), their own property or privately rented accommodation for which they are a signatory on a tenancy agreement either in the UK or overseas.     b. SLA. This rate is payable to SP who occupy SLA or Substitute Service Single Accommodation (SSSA). For the purposes of DE, accommodation in a seagoing unit is not SLA and those moving into such accommodation do not have an entitlement to DE. Where a SP occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, paragraph 0302 or Part 2, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the appropriate rate (see paragraphs 12.0108b and 12.0108c). Where SP are also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a) only one DE claim may be made.     12.0115. Child Element.

There is no specific time limit to claim the expense after posting, but it's generally recommended to claim it once you have completed the move.","['SFA or Privately Owned or Rented Accommodation. This rate is payable to SP who occupy either SFA (except see paragraph 12.0114b) or Substitute Service Families’ Accommodation (SSFA), their own property or privately rented accommodation for which they are a signatory on a tenancy agreement either in the UK or overseas. \n \n b. SLA. This rate is payable to SP who occupy SLA or Substitute Service Single Accommodation (SSSA). For the purposes of DE, accommodation in a seagoing unit is not SLA and those moving into such accommodation do not have an entitlement to DE. Where a SP occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, paragraph 0302 or Part 2, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the appropriate rate (see paragraphs 12.0108b and 12.0108c).

The SP must be recorded as PSTAT Cat 1 or 2 and have declared their children on JPA. \n \n 4 This includes the immediate issue of a Medical Pension on discharge. 5 Costs include buying new school uniform or clothing and associated items when moving a child from one school, or place of apprenticeship, to another. 6 For determination of entitlement in exceptional circumstances casework should be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. \n \n 12 - 1 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n b.

Any nursery school or playgroup is to be established under formal arrangements with the Local Education Authority (LEA) or equivalent overseas. \n \n 12.0116. Delayed Moves. The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense and DE where there is a clear intent to move on assignment. Delayed moves resulting in an entitlement to DE are as per paragraph 12.0412. SP who move into SLA on a temporary basis while arranging permanent accommodation may defer the payment of DE until they move into their selected permanent accommodation and therefore claim the appropriate rate (see paragraph 12.0114). DE may not be claimed for both moves. Delayed moves for any other reason may be authorised by DBS MIL PERS- MIL OPS PACCC. \n \n 12.0117. Mid-assignment Moves. The following rules apply for entitlement to DE on mid-assignment moves: \n \n a. DE is payable for mid-assignment moves where a move of accommodation is directed by DIO, or equivalents, or for Service reasons7. Where there are compelling welfare, medical or compassionate reasons for a mid-assignment move approval should be sought from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The CO or authorising officer should stipulate whether the case requires urgent resolution or not. \n \n b. Where the SP accommodation entitlement changes due to promotion or a change in the size of the immediate family (other than as a result of first setting up of home as per 12.0107c) the SP will normally be entitled to a mid-assignment move and therefore the associated level of DE. The SP must have an expectation of occupying the new property for at least 6 months. \n \n c. Mid-assignment moves for other personal reasons, including on estrangement, and for operational deployments do not give an entitlement to DE. \n \n d. Mid-assignment moves to or from an AWA do not give an entitlement to DE unless the SP has been ordered to in writing or the conditions in sub para a. above have been met. \n \n 12.0118. House Moves on Security Grounds. Any requirement for SP to move home as a result of a security threat, which has been verified by a Home Department Police Force, is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. Such SP are entitled to Disturbance Expenses, Refund of Legal Expenses and Movement and Storage of Personal Effects allowances and may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred. \n \n a. For Mainland UK moves, CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is at Chapter 12, Section 4. \n \n 7 Mid-Assignment Moves between SLA should be of a permanent nature i.e. for a minimum of a 6 month period as stated in Para 12.0114. \n \n 12 - 1 - 6 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n b.

Where a Service couple occupy the same private accommodation (owned or rented) or SFA/SSFA, only one individual is eligible to claim DE for that accommodation. This is normally the individual who is recognised as PStat Cat 1s. \n \n 12.0120. SP Sharing Private Accommodation. Where a SP entitled to DE moves into shared private accommodation with other SP, who are not their spouse or civil partner, the rate of the allowance payable will be as follows: \n \n a. When sharing with one other SP, who is entitled to claim DE for the move, on occupying the accommodation half the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound. \n \n b. When sharing with 2 or more other SP, who are entitled to claim DE, on occupying the accommodation one third of the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound. \n \n 12.0121. Families of Deceased SP.

The RLE scheme can refund certain expenses, including solicitor's fees, stamp duty, land registration fees, and other costs associated with buying and selling properties. To be eligible, you must meet certain conditions, such as owning the property, purchasing a new property at your new duty station, and meeting the time limits for selling and purchasing properties. You should consult with your unit HR staff or the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC to determine your eligibility for the RLE scheme and to get guidance on the application process.","['RLEs will only be paid For a property purchased within commuting distance of the qualifying assignment.

Purchase of a Property Overseas. A Service person wishing to claim RLE for the purchase of a RWA overseas during a qualifying assignment must seek prior permission from the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. Personnel who retain ownership of their principal UK residence will not be eligible under this scheme.     12.0329. Purchase of a Selected Place of Residence (SPR) before 1 Oct 88. Exceptionally, personnel who purchased a residence as a SPR before 1 Oct 88 and who sell that residence and purchase at a new duty station (i.e.a RWA) as a result of a qualifying assignment, may claim residence purchase legal expenses only, up to the RLE limit. Sale expenses will not be reimbursed in these circumstances.     Entitlement Related to the Purchase of a RWA     12.0330. Refundable RLE. The following purchase expenses, including any Value Added Tax, supported by documentary evidence, may be refunded up to the RLE limit after the refund of sale expenses:     a. Solicitor’s fees or other qualified legal agent’s fees.     b. Stamp Duty.     c. Land Registration fees.     d. Incidental solicitor’s or other qualified legal agent’s expenses.     e.

National House Building Regulation Certificate fees.     j. Valuation fees.     PART 2     RLE in Connection with Letting a RWA     General     12.0331. General Conditions. The following conditions apply:     a. The Service person must be in possession of an Assignment Order which clearly states that there is a likelihood of serving a minimum of 6 months (182 days) full time service at the new duty station from the latest of the following dates:     12 - 3 - 8 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     (1) The effective date of the start of the new assignment; or     (2) The date of joining the new duty station.     12.0332. Right of Possession. Service home owners who let their RWA rather than reclaiming their sale and purchase costs in the UK as a direct consequence of a new assignment are strongly advised, if they wish to re-occupy the residence, to establish a right of repossession on the termination of the tenancy (subject, if necessary, to any legal process). This is achieved by having an appropriate tenancy agreement drawn up, and by service of the requisite legal notices to the prospective tenants.     12.0333. Correct Legal Documentation. A right of repossession can only be safeguarded by correct application of the relevant legislation before the property is let. Service personnel should employ the services of a solicitor (or Scottish equivalent) in drawing up the appropriate tenancy agreement, which must be compliant with the Housing Act 1988 or any subsequent Act. Failure to observe these requirements may nullify any claims for refund of residence letting-tenancy fees or costs. It is emphasised that if the tenancy agreement is drawn up by a qualifying authority, such as an estate agent or property services agency, instead of a solicitor, it will be at the claimant’s own risk. In such circumstances should disputes or difficulties arise with either the agent or tenant when repossessing the property there will be no entitlement to a refund of any extra costs which result from not using a solicitor to draw up the original qualifying agreement.     Eligibility for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0334. Eligible Service Personnel. Subject to the following conditions, Regular and Reserve Service (see paragraph 12.0309) personnel making a qualifying move that results in them wishing to let their property may receive a refund of legal expenses as specified in paragraphs 12.0343 to 12.0344.     Ineligibility for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0335. Joint Ownership Expenses. Service personnel are not eligible to claim a refund of tenancy letting costs for expenses that have, or will be, claimed by a joint owner from any other source. They may, however, receive reasonable refunds for up to the value of the allowable expenses that have not been, and will not be, claimed by any other joint owner(s).     12.0336 Non-Residential Use. If any part of the property is, or will be, used for other than purely residential letting purposes, (e.g.a farm, boarding house or shop), RLE Letting expenses may not be claimed.     Conditions for Fees on Letting a RWA     12.0337. Length of Occupation of Property. The property being let must have been a RWA, and the Service person must normally have occupied the property for at least a 6- month period during an assignment.     12.0338. Property Ownership. The property being let must be owned either solely or jointly by the Service person.     12.0339. Accompanied Service. Service personnel in PStat Cat 1 (including all sub-     12 - 3 - 9 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     categories) and 2 must be accompanied by their families, unless they are serving INVOLSEP, at the new duty station in order to qualify for RLE on letting.     12.0340. Service Joint Ownership. If the property is owned by more than one Service person, the refunds will be divided by the number of Service owners who meet all the other qualifying conditions and paid only to them.     12.0341. Restrictions on Sale. Service personnel who decide to let their residence and claim a refund of tenancy agreement costs will not then be eligible for a refund of expenses for selling the residence until the next or subsequent assignments.     12.0342 Returning to the Property. ', 'The claimant must own the qualifying residence that is being sold and it must be, or have been, a previous RWA; and     c. The claimant must purchase a RWA at the new duty station (but see paragraph 12.0320 concerning personnel in possession of a HREC); and     d.

Ownership. The properties being sold and purchased must be owned either solely or jointly by the Service person(s) claiming RLE.     Conditions Relating to Joint Ownership     12.0315.

Service personnel, whose circumstances on assignment meet one of those defined below may be issued with a HREC, authorised by their CO (or their designated representative). The HREC (Annex A) is to be raised in duplicate, with one copy being handed to the Service person and one retained in their personnel records. Claimants should not make financial arrangements on the presumption of their application being agreed. The HREC entitles them to be refunded sale expenses, and be permitted to defer the subsequent purchase and retain eligibility for a refund of purchase expenses until a future qualifying assignment. HRECs may be authorised in the following circumstances: \n \n a. Service personnel assigned within the UK who are unable to purchase a suitable property within commuting distance of the new duty station as well as being unable to let their current property. Applications must be supported by documentary evidence showing that: \n \n (1) Suitable properties are not available for purchase within commuting distance of the new duty station because of much higher prices (a selection of estate agent’s notices showing prices from areas within commuting distance of the new duty station is acceptable); and \n \n (2) Attempts to let the current property at a fair market rent over a period of at least 3 months have been unsuccessful, supported by either a solicitor’s or estate agent’s letter stating that the property has been on the market at a fair market rent and there have been no agreed tenancies. This letter should show the rent at which the property has been placed on the rental market, as well as the rent of similar properties in the local area; or \n \n (3) The mortgage lender prevents letting; or \n \n (4) The anticipated rent is less than the Service person’s mortgage repayment. \n \n or \n \n b. The Service person is assigned overseas, to London (defined as the area bounded by the M25), NI, RAF Valley, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the \n \n 12 - 3 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n Scottish Outer Isles and opts not to purchase at their new duty station; or \n \n c. The Service person is required for Service reasons to occupy an ex-officio/tied SFA at the new duty station; or \n \n d. The Service person is assigned to a course for a period of between 6 and 12 months. This will permit purchase at the new duty station to be deferred for 6-12 months once the HREC has been issued. \n \n 12.0321. Valid Period of HREC.', 'b. The Service person’s spouse/civil partner dies. \n \n c. The Service person and, if married or in a civil partnership, the immediate family move to a new duty station for Service reasons; this excludes a move following misconduct or a disciplinary offence or as a consequence of an application for a move that is submitted by the Service person. \n \n d. The Service person is prematurely discharged by invaliding or compulsorily retired from the Services for reasons beyond their control. \n \n e. Where negative equity can be demonstrated on the sale of a property purchased within the last 12 months and for this reason no subsequent purchase is made, a case may be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC to waive the recovery of any sale expenses. The case may include a request for a HREC. \n \n 12 - 3 - 6 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n Conditions Relating to the Sale of a RWA \n \n 12.0324. The Property to be Sold. The property to be sold must be a RWA occupied by the Service person, or have previously been a RWA. Where the property is used as a RWA only, the Service person must have travelled daily, or had an expectation of travelling daily, from it to a current or former duty station for a period of not less than 6 months. Where the property is also used as an AWA then the SP must instead have followed their agreed Flexible Working Agreement authorised by their CoC in accordance with JSP750 (Centrally Determined Terms of Service). \n \n Entitlement Relating to the Sale of a RWA \n \n 12.0325. Refundable Expenses. The following expenses, including Value Added Tax, when supported by documentary evidence (Completion Statement and a receipted bill for costs paid), may be refunded up to the RLE limit: \n \n a. All necessary legal expenses of sale, including legal expenses incurred on redemption of a mortgage. \n \n b. Estate agent’s or auctioneer’s fees, including advertising costs if these are charged separately. \n \n c. Advertising costs where an estate agent or auctioneer is not employed. \n \n d. The payment of penalty fees on the unavoidable early redemption of a mortgage, or in lieu of notice of redemption. The early redemption of a mortgage, and any resulting penalty fees, are deemed to be avoidable if it is possible for the Service person to transfer the existing mortgage to a new property without incurring penalty charges. Therefore penalty charges will normally only be reimbursed where a Service person is granted a HREC. However, where a Service person moving home in order to undertake an assignment without a HREC can demonstrate to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC (evidence from the previous mortgage provider would be necessary) that interest charges are unavoidable then they may be reimbursed within the limits prescribed in paragraph 12.0312f. The penalty charges, where they are regarded as unavoidable, will be reimbursed subject to a maximum limit of the value of 3 months interest on the balance of the mortgage outstanding. \n \n e.', 'Method of Claim. Rail travel will normally be funded using the Defence Travel Lodged ePC or a Service arranged ticket. Where one cannot be provided eligible Service personnel may exceptionally reclaim their actual rail costs by submitting an Expenses Claim as detailed in the JPA Self Service User Guide.

Accomodated in a HRG booked hotel and driving an MT fleet car.
2. This visit is iaw the criteria laid out in the approved business case (PSA).
REQUEST DIRECTION
3. I have saved all of my reciepts from this trip so far and have paid all meals out of my own
pocket. Some days have been slightly over and some under the £30 subsistence stated on
the BC.
4. The hotel has informed me that I will have to pay for parking (£15.00 a day) at their facility,
which was not anticipated.
5. My question is, how do I claim all of my expenses back from the MET office trip? Specififcally,
what JPA allowance would this fall under (subsistence, FIA etc)?
TIMING
6. IAW HR 1 Battle Rhythm.","Parking fees can be claimed on JPA expenses under other duty travel, it’s on the same drop-down menu as subsistence
expense.
You can claim day subsistence for the food up to the daily £30 cap, the claim amount should either the receipted costs

Service personnel in receipt of automated HDT (see Chapter 7 Section 3) who undertake duty journeys to locations other than their permanent duty station, which start or end at their RWA, will be required to abate any claim received by the daily HDT rate.     06.0412. Insurance Cover. A Service person who uses their private motor vehicle for authorised duty journeys must ensure an F/MT 102 has been completed and that the private motor vehicle is insured for business use, has valid Road Tax and a current MoT, and that all are valid on the date the duty journey is undertaken. However, Service personnel using their private motor vehicle for a permanent assignment (or mid- assignment) move are to check with their insurance company that a move to their new accommodation is covered under Social, Domestic and Pleasure usage.     06.0413. Supporting Documentation and Audit. A Service person claiming MMA must retain a copy of the authorised FMT 1000 (see paragraph 06.0405), and a copy of their insurance policy, to support the claim.

Service personnel who use a private bicycle for duty journeys will be granted MMA at the published rates for bicycles. The current rates are at Chapter 3 Section 1.     Rates     06.0415. Rate Calculation Methodology. Fractions of miles are to be mathematically rounded up or down to the nearest whole mile (i.e. <1.4 miles = 1 mile, >1.5 = 2 miles). The rates of MMA are calculated annually by CDP(AF Rem) Allces (as at 1st April) using the methodology as follows:     a. Overseas MMA. The Overseas rates of MMA are produced by DGCP HR Ops, usually annually wef 1 October and include “Duty Free” and “Duty Paid” rates for some countries. The rate used should depend on whether the claimant used “Duty Free” (e.g. purchased with petrol coupons) or “Duty Paid” fuel for their duty journey.     b. Passenger Allowance Rate. The passenger allowance rate is a nominal rate which makes a token payment towards the increased fuel cost and wear and tear resulting from carrying a passenger on an authorised journey (see paragraph 06.0409). The rate is not changed annually but is reviewed every 5 years by     6 - 4 - 3 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     CDP(AF Rem) Allces to determine whether it is still valid. The rate must remain beneath the HMRC Passenger Allowance cap per mile.     c. Sports Equipment Supplement. This supplement is a nominal rate which makes a token payment towards the cost of any abnormal deterioration to the interior of the vehicle caused by carrying the equipment. The rate is not changed annually but is reviewed every 5 years by CDP(AF Rem) Allces to determine whether it is still valid.     All the above rates (except the Overseas rates of MMA) are published in the annual CDP(AF Rem) Allces Directed Letter “Rates of Entitlement for Allowances for Service Personnel”. The current rates are shown in Chapter 3 Section 1. The Overseas rates of MMA are published separately by CDP(AF Rem) Allces Directed Letter.     Method of Claim     06.0416. Method of Claim.

', 'The receipted ticket must be retained by the claimant for 24 months for audit purposes.     06.0904. Taxi. In addition to those journeys outlined at paragraph 06.0902, refunds of taxicab fares are also admissible for journeys, including those of less than one mile, within the following criteria:     a. Service personnel are making a duty journey when one of the following conditions is met:     (1) They are necessarily carrying heavy baggage. The amount of personal baggage needed for duties of one or 2 nights only is not justifiable in claiming the use of a taxicab at public expense.     (2) The Service person would not have arrived at their destination at the required time by using public transport.     (3) For prisoners and escorts when they cannot be conveyed by rail.     b. For immediate families of all ranks, whether accompanied or unaccompanied by the Service member of the family, when necessarily travelling with heavy baggage, where no suitable public transport is available.     c. The Service person or their immediate family have a medical certificate signed by a medical officer stating that they are unable to travel by a cheaper mode of transport. The certificate is to be retained for 24 months by the Service person with a copy of their claim to be produced for audit purposes when requested.     d. Service personnel carrying classified documents that are too heavy or bulky to be carried on public transport.     e. In exceptional circumstances, not covered by the above, OF4 or above may authorise taxi hire.     6 - 9 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     Service personnel travelling in or through London, without baggage, for a distance too great to walk are to use public transport, but not taxis. Service personnel on duty in MOD London at conferences, meetings or interviews, are not to claim taxi fares for journeys that should have been taken by other means of public transport, except as detailed at paragraph 06.0904a(2) or other exceptional circumstances.     06.0905. Private Vehicles. The regulations concerning the submission of a claim for duty travel by private vehicle are contained in Section 4 of this Chapter. For the purpose of this section the term ‘a private vehicle’ means a:     a. Motor car (including people carriers, 4x4s, and other types of car).     b. Motor cycle.     c. Bicycle.     The vehicle may be regarded as private if it is:     d. Owned by the Service person or being bought on hire purchase and registered in their name and the insurance requirements are met and specifically cover its use on official business (see Section 4 of this Chapter); or     e. Privately hired by the Service person and the insurance requirements are met and specifically cover its use on official business (see Section 4 of this Chapter); or     f. Registered in the name of the Service person’s spouse/civil partner and the insurance requirements are met and specifically cover its use on official business (see Section 4 of this Chapter).     06.0906. Car Hire. Hired transport may be used in preference to public transport when the official method of transport is uneconomic, impractical or unsuitable. In all cases budget holders should be consulted (see JSP 800 Volume 5).     06.0907. Motorcycles and Bicycles. Service personnel who regularly use their own motorcycle or bicycle for duty journeys, for which travelling expenses are permissible, may be granted an allowance as shown in Section 4 of this Chapter.     06.0908. Saving of Time in the Interests of the Service. Where road transport is used, expenses are allowed for the cheapest or most direct route, except where the CO is satisfied that a more expensive journey effects a saving of time which is advantageous on Service grounds. The claimant is to keep a record of these reasons for audit purposes. Where a Service person elects to use an alternative route, that is not the most direct, because it is longer but quicker, they may claim MMA for the actual distance travelled subject to the following conditions:     a. The alternative route was taken (including motorways) to avoid congested areas, road works or other temporary hazards.     b. Where the distance is appreciably greater than the direct route (e.g. more than 10% further) an explanation of the route taken and why is to be retained by the claimant with a copy of the claim.     6 - 9 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     c. Assessment of the distance travelled is to be undertaken with reference to a motoring organisation handbook or route planner, normally based on the most direct route.     06.0909. Additional Fees. When a Service person performing a duty journey by Service-owned transport, or approved to travel by private motor vehicle, necessarily incurs incidental costs such as those listed below, the actual expenditure may be reclaimed:     a. Parking fees.     b. Tolls.     c. Inland ferry charges.     d. Parking meter charges.     e. Garage charges overnight, where the vehicle could not be garaged under Service arrangements.     f. Daily congestion charges. (See para 06.0910)     g. Clean Air Zone charges.     Receipts should be obtained and retained for 24 months for all expenditure to support the claim. Where a receipted bill is not obtainable, a written justification for any expense must be kept with a copy of the claim by the claimant.     06.0910. Congestion Charges. For regulations covering reimbursement of Congestion Charges see Section 2 of Chapter 8.     Overseas Theatres     06.0911. General. Journeys in overseas theatres are to be performed by the cheapest suitable means of transport available as determined by the Service person or the chain of command. The rules for the UK in paragraphs 06.0901 to 06.0910 are generally to be applied, except where they relate to circumstances peculiar to the UK.     Method of Claim     06.0912. Method of Claim. Claims for MMA, actual public transport costs or additional fees will be made via Expense Claims as detailed in the JPA Self Service User Guide. For those personnel with no access to the JPA on-line system, JPA Form F016 is to be completed and submitted to unit HR Admin staff for input onto JPA using the Zoom facility.

Method of Payment. ', 'Eligibility     05.0404. Eligible Service Personnel. MOE may be claimed by Service personnel who, for duty reasons:     a. Necessarily incur expense in obtaining meals from commercial retail outlets at a greater cost than would be incurred in a Service messing facility at their place of assignment, provided they meet all of the following conditions:     (1) Necessarily buy meals in commercial retail outlets on at least 9 occasions for Regular Service personnel and 2 occasions for Volunteer Reserve Service personnel1 or Regular Service personnel serving with Reserve Units during the calendar month for which the allowance is claimed.     1 This includes Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), Royal Marines Reserve (RMR), Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF), RAF Reserve (RAFR) and Army Reserve (AR), but does not include all forms of Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS), Sponsored Reserves, Non-Regular Permanent Staff (NRPS), Additional Duties Commitment (ADC) and Mobilised Reserves who will remain at 9 occasions per month.     5 - 4 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     (2) Cannot, in the time available for the meals, be reasonably expected to return to a Service messing facility.

(4) Are not in receipt of Lodging Allowance (see Chapter 5 Section 3), Subsistence (see Section 1 of this Chapter), Food and Incidentals Allowance (see Section 5 of this Chapter), Special Messing Allowance (see Section 6 of this Chapter) or the Unaccompanied Living Out rates of Local Overseas Allowance (see Chapter 9 Section 7).     b. Exceptional Circumstances. Whilst not exhaustive, the following are examples of the type of scenarios where exceptional authority for payment of MOE could be justified.     (1) Permanent Staff Instructors (PSIs) attending drill nights ought not to be expected to bring in packed meals to cover 2 consecutive meals (lunch and dinner). Where PSIs are already required to bring a packed meal for lunch, then MOE should be claimed for an evening meal on drill nights, provided all other criteria are met.     (2) There are a small number of establishments where it is prohibited to bring food into the workplace. In these circumstances, MOE could be justified if Service personnel cannot, in the time available for meals, be reasonably expected to return home or reach a Service messing facility.     Ineligibility     05.0405. Ineligible Service Personnel. Those occupying SFA, SSFA, privately owned or rented property, or in receipt of any of a number of other specified accommodation or subsistence expenses detailed in 05.0404.a(4) above are not eligible for MOE. Service personnel who consume food at, or could bring food in from, their normal place of residence3 for the duty period are also ineligible to claim MOE. Service personnel who consume food in, or could obtain a packed meal from, a Service messing facility are also ineligible to claim MOE.     Conditions     05.0406. Reclaim the Daily Food Charge. Amended/Updated. Personnel may also be eligible to Reclaim the Daily Food Charge for the same meal as MOE is paid, under the provisions of Section 4 of this Chapter.     05.0407. Receipts. Service personnel are required to retain a copy of all claims with supporting receipts for a period of 24 months from the date of the claim. It is emphasised that these documents are to be retained by the Service person who should be able to produce them for inspection/audit when required.     2 Where a Service messing facility is unable to provide a packed meal, the unit responsible must certify that this facility is unavailable before a claim for MOE can be made. 3 SFA, SSFA, privately owned or rented property, or in receipt of any of the allowances detailed within para 05.0404a(4).     5 - 4 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     Rates     05.0408. Rate Calculation - UK MOE. The rates of UK MOE are set annually (as at 1 April) by CDP(AF Rem) Allces4. MOE does not represent the full cost of a commercial meal because it is designed to contribute towards the difference between the cost of a meal in Service messing facility and a commercial retail outlet. The current percentages used to calculate these rates are:     a. Breakfast - 30% of the Daily Food Charge.     b. Third Meal (normally lunch) - 70% of the Daily Food Charge.     c. Main Meal - 100% of the Daily Food Charge.     The rates of UK MOE are published in the annual CDP(AF Rem) Allces Directed Letter “Annual Pay Review - Revised Allowance Rates for the RN/RM, the Army and the RAF”. The rates are also repeated within the annual CDP(AF Rem) Allces Directed Letter “Rates of Entitlement for Allowances for Service Personnel”. The current rates are at Chapter 3 Section 1.     05.0409. Overseas MOE. MOE should be claimed at the UK rates (see Chapter 3 Section 1) or the actual meal costs, whichever is the lesser.     Method of Claim     05.0410. Method of Claim. Claims for MOE are to be made by eligible Service personnel using the JPA Expenses Claim system as detailed in the JPA Self Service User Guide. They are to be submitted monthly in arrears and may be aggregated over the whole period of the calendar month for which the allowance is claimed, rather than accounting for expenditure against a daily limit. All claims must be receipted actuals for reimbursement of additional costs necessarily incurred as a result of purchasing meals at commercial retail outlets. For those personnel with no access to the JPA on-line system, JPA Form F016 is to be completed and submitted to unit HR Admin staff for input onto JPA using the Zoom facility.

SMA is then paid at an automatic daily rate, and no receipts are required. Where host nation messing facilities3 are available for certain meals, further rate adjustments may be made in line with the following percentages; 15% for breakfast, 35% for the third meal and 50% for the main meal.

SP leaving the Services unless entitled to Final Tour of Duty (12.0112b), redundancy or being medically discharged (12.0112a).     c. SP assigned to the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) are ineligible for both their move to and from their EUMS assignment as they receive EU Daily Subsistence Allowance (EUDSA) (see Chapter 9 Section 10).     d. University Cadets, Medical or Dental Cadets and Foundation Year 1&2 Doctors, including re-designated deferred University Cadet Entrants (UCEs), are ineligible when in receipt of pay that includes an element for education grant.     Qualifying Criteria     12.0106. Qualifying Moves. It is the move of the SP, not the immediate family (except under circumstances in 12.0121, 12.0109 or 12.0108a), which provides eligibility for DE. To qualify for DE SP must:     a. Be ordered in writing to move to a new place of duty to undertake a permanent assignment following Phase 1 training1 or on subsequent qualifying moves (but see 12.0105); or     b. Be required to move from a RWA to temporary accommodation awaiting a further assignment (e.g. on an extended period of sickness). Where the subsequent assignment necessitates a further move to a RWA this will also attract DE; or     c. Undertake a mid-assignment move as detailed at 12.0117 or     d. Undertake a move in advance of an extended operational tour as detailed at Annex B to Section 1 of Chapter 2 para 1(j) and 12.0412(m).     For the purposes of Remote Working (RW), DE may be claimed by Service persons moving to or from an Alternative Work Address (AWA) when making a qualifying move on permanent assignment. SP will not be entitled to DE when making a mid-assignment move to an AWA unless ordered to in writing (See 12.0117). Where the SP’s AWA is separate to their RWA, DE may only be claimed from one of these.     2 This does not include Service personnel who are currently transitioning to Phase 1 training in another Service or those Service personnel commissioning, or transferring to Non-Commissioned Aircrew terms of service, from the ranks, who are eligible.     12 - 1 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     12.0107. Non-Qualifying Moves. Amended/Updated. The following moves are ineligible:     a. Where SP move between 2 Selected Places of Residence (SPR).     b. Where SP return from an assignment, where they occupied public accommodation, to a property that they previously lived in and which their family continued to occupy during their absence (e.g. those returning from SSSA to a home that has been continually occupied by their family, or single SP returning to privately owned or rented property that has not been let, or those returning to a home under Final Tour of Duty moves).     c. Where a couple move accommodation mid-assignment following their marriage/civil partnership, regardless of whether they have established a home prior to marriage/civil partnership.     d. Amended/Updated. When SP move into accommodation in a seagoing unit3.     e. When SP undertake operational tours.     f. Moves between SLA within the same Unit unless detailed in 12.0117.     g. When SP are in the final 6 months of their service. Where eligible, SP may be entitled to claim the Final Tour of Duty Allowance (See Chapter 12, Section 5).     12.0108. Qualifying Residences. To qualify for DE SP must be entitled to move at public expense and the move must be to or from a RWA. For remote working purposes, an AWA will also be considered a qualifying residence where the criteria in para 12.0106 are met.     a. If a SP elects to serve unaccompanied (UnAcc) and settle their immediate family in a SPR in the UK, DE may be claimed at the SFA or privately owned or rented accommodation Rate.     b. Where a SP assigned in the UK occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464 Part 1, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the SLA rate unless they are also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a).     c. Where a SP assigned overseas occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 2, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate. If that SP is also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a) only one DE claim may be made.     d. Where a SP successfully applies to occupy surplus SFA on assignment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, Chapter 9, DE will be paid at the SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate; this does not confer entitlement to any other relocation allowances unless mentioned within the specific chapters. The SP     3 A move to a seagoing unit where policy prevents SP from being accommodated onboard and therefore SP will be accommodated in SLA, is a qualifying move.     12 - 1 - 3 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     will not be eligible to claim further DE should they be required to vacate the surplus SFA in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, paragraph 0905.     e. ', 'Child Element. The Child Element of DE contributes towards the additional costs5 faced by Service parents when their child(ren) are required to change school as a direct result of the SP being permanently assigned to a new duty station. SP entitled to DE may claim the Child Element for each child (as defined at 02.0110) who is receiving full-time education, which includes nursery school or technical college. The following conditions must also be met to be eligible to claim the Child Element of DE6 :     a. The SP must be recorded as PSTAT Cat 1 or 2 and have declared their children on JPA.     4 This includes the immediate issue of a Medical Pension on discharge.     5 Costs include buying new school uniform or clothing and associated items when moving a child from one school, or place of apprenticeship, to another.     6 For determination of entitlement in exceptional circumstances casework should be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12 - 1 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. The SP must be eligible for the SFA / SSSFA / Privately Owned/Rented rate of DE. SP claiming the SLA rate of DE will not ordinarily be eligible for the Child Element of DE.     c. Any nursery school or playgroup is to be established under formal arrangements with the Local Education Authority (LEA) or equivalent overseas.     12.0116. Delayed Moves. The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense and DE where there is a clear intent to move on assignment. Delayed moves resulting in an entitlement to DE are as per paragraph 12.0412. SP who move into SLA on a temporary basis while arranging permanent accommodation may defer the payment of DE until they move into their selected permanent accommodation and therefore claim the appropriate rate (see paragraph 12.0114). DE may not be claimed for both moves. Delayed moves for any other reason may be authorised by DBS MIL PERS- MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0117. Mid-assignment Moves. The following rules apply for entitlement to DE on mid-assignment moves:     a. DE is payable for mid-assignment moves where a move of accommodation is directed by DIO, or equivalents, or for Service reasons7. Where there are compelling welfare, medical or compassionate reasons for a mid-assignment move approval should be sought from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The CO or authorising officer should stipulate whether the case requires urgent resolution or not.     b. Where the SP accommodation entitlement changes due to promotion or a change in the size of the immediate family (other than as a result of first setting up of home as per 12.0107c) the SP will normally be entitled to a mid-assignment move and therefore the associated level of DE. The SP must have an expectation of occupying the new property for at least 6 months.     c. Mid-assignment moves for other personal reasons, including on estrangement, and for operational deployments do not give an entitlement to DE.     d. Mid-assignment moves to or from an AWA do not give an entitlement to DE unless the SP has been ordered to in writing or the conditions in sub para a. above have been met.     12.0118. House Moves on Security Grounds. Any requirement for SP to move home as a result of a security threat, which has been verified by a Home Department Police Force, is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. Such SP are entitled to Disturbance Expenses, Refund of Legal Expenses and Movement and Storage of Personal Effects allowances and may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred.     a. For Mainland UK moves, CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is at Chapter 12, Section 4.     7 Mid-Assignment Moves between SLA should be of a permanent nature i.e. for a minimum of a 6 month period as stated in Para 12.0114.     12 - 1 - 6 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. For Northern Ireland moves, Comd 38 (Irish) Brigade is responsible for authorising all claims, having consulted with CDP(AF Rem) staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is contained within 38 (Irish) Brigade Standing Instructions (NISO 119).     12.0119. Service Couples. Where a Service couple occupy the same private accommodation (owned or rented) or SFA/SSFA, only one individual is eligible to claim DE for that accommodation. This is normally the individual who is recognised as PStat Cat 1s.     12.0120. SP Sharing Private Accommodation. Where a SP entitled to DE moves into shared private accommodation with other SP, who are not their spouse or civil partner, the rate of the allowance payable will be as follows:     a. When sharing with one other SP, who is entitled to claim DE for the move, on occupying the accommodation half the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     b. When sharing with 2 or more other SP, who are entitled to claim DE, on occupying the accommodation one third of the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     12.0121. Families of Deceased SP. Following the death of a SP, their immediate family is entitled to DE for any move between Service accommodation and for their final move from Service accommodation into private accommodation.     12.0122. Evacuated Families. For entitlement to DE as a consequence of emergency evacuation from an overseas assignment, see Section 6 to this Chapter.     Rates     12.0123. Method of Rate Calculation. The rates are based upon the average additional expenditure incurred when SP are required to move into a RWA at a new duty station in the UK or overseas. MOD then determines the type of expenditure it will support (e.g. at present it will support the cost of providing new school uniforms; but it will not support the loss of income as a result of a spouse/civil partner or partner giving up their employment). The full list of items to which DE currently contributes is at Annex A to this Section.     12.0124. Publication of Rates of DE. The rates of DE will be published in the annual CDP Rem Directed Letter “Rates of Entitlement for Allowances for SP”. The current rates are also at Chapter 3 Section 1.     Method of Claim     12.0125. Method of Claim. Claims for DE may be submitted 45 days prior to the expected move date. Service personnel are to claim using the JPA on-line self-service system.

Aim. The aim of Disturbance Expense (DE) is to contribute towards the necessary additional expenses that may arise when the Services require their personnel to make a qualifying move to or from a RWA on permanent assignment. \n \n 12.0102. Scope. DE applies for moves within the UK, between the UK and overseas, overseas and UK or moves between overseas stations. Expenditure associated with moving from one residence to another varies from move to move. The expenses (see Annex A to this Section) that underpin the DE rates are kept under constant review to ensure the rates cover expenses incurred in the majority of moves. Some SP will find that the expenses incurred in connection with a particular move will be higher than the allowance paid, while for other moves expenses will be lower. Over the course of a full career, therefore, DE will have made a significant contribution towards costs incurred. \n \n 12.0103. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Section 271 to 287 elements of DE are taxable. Where required, tax and NICs will be met by MOD and paid by DBS under a PSA for: \n \n a.

The SP is accompanied and occupying SFA/SSFA in the UK and needs to move their family to an SPR in the UK due to a new assignment that requires a change of duty station. Moves must be undertaken within 6 months of reporting for duty at the new assignment, exceptions will only be considered in exceptional circumstances via casework submissions to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. \n \n (1) SP occupying privately owned RWA are not eligible for publicly funded relocations to an SPR, unless they qualify under FTOD rules or are assigned to a seagoing unit. \n \n (2) The costs of relocating to a SPR must not exceed the cost of a move by the MOD contractor to the new duty station. If the cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0428). \n \n (3) When occupying an SPR and moving on assignment to an RWA at a new duty station, the cost of the move will be limited to the cost of a move by the MOD contractor between the two duty stations. If the actual move cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0427). \n \n (4) Moves from one SPR to another SPR will not be funded at public expense. \n \n j. SP are required to change their RWA on temporary assignment or temporary unaccompanied assignment. If the new RWA is still within a reasonable traveling distance of the old duty station (see paragraph 12.0405), this is subject to tax liability. \n \n k. If a SP is required by virtue of their rank or assignment to occupy tied SFA that is fully furnished and used for official duties, they can remove their entitled volume of PE to the tied SFA or store it at public expense. The combined quantity of PE removed and stored must not exceed the individual's entitlement. When the individual is required to vacate the tied SFA due to an assignment, the PE will be moved from the tied SFA or the storage location at public expense to either the previous SPR/RWA or a new SPR/RWA (but see 12.0412d (2) and (3)). \n \n l. SP assigned on Loan Service are eligible unless the host nation's Loan Service Terms and Conditions of Service (LSTACOS) provide a separate provision for a move. \n \n (1) SP assigned to the European Union Military Staff are entitled to removals at public expense using the MOD Contractor. They are then not entitled to claim the monthly allowance specified in Chapter 3, Article 16, Para 2 of the European External Action Service rules. \n \n m. If a SP intends to marry or become a civil partner within 3 months of starting an overseas assignment and plans for their spouse or civil partner to join them within that timeframe, a move at public expense is allowed. If the marriage or civil partnership is delayed beyond 3 months or cancelled, the move will be treated as a mid-assignment move upon the first setting up of a home, and the SP may be required to repay shipment and/or storage costs. \n \n 12 - 4 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24) \n \n \n \n \n  https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428\n \n \n \n  https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428\n \n \n \n  https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#ch7_0305Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n n.

SP who move under the Army over 37 provision (see Section 7 of this Chapter). \n \n q. For the first move of family PE after the breakup of a marriage or civil partnership on change in PStat Cat, the volume of PE moved will remain within the authorised entitlement. The immediate family or Service Person are entitled to move their PE within the normal entitlement. However, since a personal contribution towards the costs may apply, only the Service person can enter into an agreement with the Contractor: \n \n (1) From a RWA at the SP’s duty station to a location in the UK9. \n \n (2) From a RWA at the SP's duty station to a location in the Country of Origin (CoO) of a non-British passport holder spouse/civil partner, but not to any other country. The cost of a move from the UK will be capped at the average cost of a move within the UK on assignment, or capped at the cost of a return move to Catterick Garrison if assigned overseas10.

A Qualifying Assignment is one for which a Service person is in possession of a permanent assignment order requiring them to move to a new duty station, which clearly indicates a likelihood of serving a minimum of 12 months at the new duty station. For RLE Letting a Qualifying Assignment is one which clearly indicates that the Service Person is likely to serve at least 6 months (182 days) at the new duty station. \n \n 12.0304. Commuting Distance. For the purposes of these regulations, the acceptable commuting distance is defined as being within 50 miles of the duty station or, if over 50 miles, within 90 minutes’ travelling time by public transport. \n \n 12.0305. Qualifying Residence. For the purpose of these regulations a qualifying residence is defined as being a static home (e.g.house, flat, maisonette, bungalow or mobile home). Houseboats, caravans and dedicated business premises (but see paragraph 12.0313) are not qualifying residences. \n \n For the purposes of Remote Working (RW), RLE may only be claimed for an Alternative Work Address (AWA) where the residence is also the Service Persons RWA. \n \n 12.0306.

Meals should be interpreted as prepared food, which is defined as food made by a manufacturer, restaurant or food outlet, to be ready for consumption at the point of sale or temporary duty location (thus replacing what would be provided by the Service mess facility); exceptionally, microwavable meals are included in this definition. As an example, a packet of crisps or a chocolate bar does not constitute a meal.     b. Commercial Retail Outlet. A commercial retail outlet is any establishment that sells prepared food.     c. Service Messing Facility. A Service Messing Facility may be in the UK or overseas and is any cookhouse, canteen, galley, mess dining room or temporary facility where food is provided under Service arrangements.

You may need to provide evidence to demonstrate that you are the centre of and prime mover in your stepson's life.","['If the date of change in circumstances is in doubt, or the CO (or their authorised representative) is unable to satisfy themselves that the change of PStat Cat has been made in accordance with these regulations then the individual may be directed to submit casework to the Defence Business Service (DBS) Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell (PACCC). Retrospective application of any change in PStat Cat may be withheld if the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC considers that the notification of the change has been unreasonably postponed.     Status     02.0203. Personal Status Category. All Service personnel are to be placed into one of the following PStat Cats:     a. PStat Cat 1. Those in PStat Cat 1 will satisfy one of the following qualifying criteria:     (1) They are legally married and living with their spouse, or who would be but for the exigencies of the Services.     (2) They are registered in a civil partnership in accordance with the Civil Partnership Act, or are in a civil partnership under an overseas scheme recognised under that Act, and are living with their registered civil partner, or would be but for the exigencies of the Services.     b. PStat Cat 2. Those in PStat Cat 2 will have parental responsibility within the terms of the Children Act 1989 for a child and satisfy all of the following conditions (but see also paragraph 02.0204):     (1) They have full residence of the child and can properly be regarded as the centre of and prime mover in the child’s life. The Service person will not be categorised PStat Cat 2 where the child is normally resident with their other     2 - 2 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     natural parent or legal guardian and reside in a separate place of residence to the SP1.     (2) They provide a home where they would normally live with the child except when unable to do so during periods of absence directly attributable to their service in the Armed Forces.     (3) They provide, where the child is unable to care for itself, a carer who can look after the child during periods of absence directly attributable to their service in the Armed Forces. The child carer must not be the other natural parent of the child (but see paragraph 02.0204c).     (4) That they accept financial responsibility for the child.     c. PStat Cat 3. A member of the Services who is not in PStat Cat 1 or 2 and who provides financial support for their spouse, former spouse, civil partner, former civil partner, or any dependant child by voluntary agreement. In this case, voluntary agreement means financial support provided other than by an order made by a court, a Child Support Agency arrangement, or the MOD under the relevant Service Act.     d. PStat Cat 4. A member of the Services who is not in PStat Cat 1 or 2 and who provides financial support for their spouse, former spouse, civil partner, former civil partner or any dependant child under an order made by a court, by a Child Support Agency arrangement, or the MOD under the relevant Service Act.     e. PStat Cat 5. All other members of the Services.     02.0204. PStat Cat 2 Guidance. Whether the Service person can properly be regarded as the centre of and prime mover in the life of the child will depend on a number of factors about which it may be necessary to make further enquiries. The following points should be considered:     a. Is the Service person the recipient of Child Benefit (CB) for the child in question? Where an individual other than the Service person is the recipient of CB then the child is not normally resident with the Service person who cannot then be the centre of and prime mover in their child’s life.     b. Does the Service person maintain a home of their own where the child is normally resident? If the Service person does not, and the child is normally resident with some other person(s), the disadvantages of Service life will not affect the child. It is the responsibility of the Service person to demonstrate that they provide the home at which the child is normally resident.     c. How much staying contact2 does the other natural parent have with the child? Despite the provisions of paragraph 02.0203b(3), it is not intended to prevent all staying contact nor any provision of care by the other natural parent to the child. However, the more contact the other natural parent has with the child, the less likely     1 Where the SP is in a LTR (E) and cohabiting with the other natural parent or legal guardian of their dependent child they may be catogorised as P Stat 2. In this instance 02.0204c can be discounted.     2 Staying Contact is where the child stays overnight with the other natural parent.     2 - 2 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     it is that the child will be subject to the requirements of their parent’s service. It is the responsibility of the Service person to demonstrate that such contact is not excessive or contrary to requirements of paragraph 02.0203b. There are no restrictions on staying contact for the child’s other natural parent when the Service person is classed as INVOLSEP in accordance with paragraph 1 of Annex B to Section 1 of this chapter, (e.g. deployment on operations, exercise or waiting to occupy SFA).     d. Does the child spend the majority of time when not at school at the Service person’s home and are the majority of the child’s possessions there?     e. Is the child registered with a Medical Surgery at the Service person’s location and what address is recorded as the child’s home?     f. Do the records held by the child’s school show the Service person’s residence as the child’s home address?     g. Does the Service person draw Child Tax Credit? Where eligible, Child Tax Credit must be drawn by the Service person as it may only be claimed by an eligible individual with whom the child is living.     h. When did the change in PStat Cat take place? There may be difficulties during transition from PStat Cat 1 to PStat Cat 2 and provision exists for a 3 month reconciliation period in which to arrange affairs. However, until a Service person has demonstrated that they are the centre of and the prime mover in their child’s life, there is no entitlement to PStat Cat 2. Future intentions can be taken into account only if there is actual evidence of intent, e.g., the setting up of a separate home.     i. How old is the child in question? ', 'However, until a Service person has demonstrated that they are the centre of and the prime mover in their child’s life, there is no entitlement to PStat Cat 2. Future intentions can be taken into account only if there is actual evidence of intent, e.g., the setting up of a separate home.     i. How old is the child in question? When a child has reached the age of 18 and is not in full-time education or no longer meets the definition of a child (see paragraph 02.0110 of this Chapter) then Service personnel in PStat Cat 2 may no longer be entitled to that status and the associated entitlements, (e.g., Service Families Accommodation and Allowances).     02.0205. Service, Civil Service and Welfare Organisation Spouse or Civil Partner. When the spouse or civil partner of the Service person is also a member of the Services (s), or the UK Civil Service (c), or a recognised welfare organisation3 (c), then the PStat Cat is to bear the additional suffix of ‘s’ or ‘c’. The Service person and their spouse or civil partner will elect which spouse or civil partner will be PStat Cat 1 and which will be PStat Cat 5 (or the Civil Service equivalent). A spouse or civil partner in a welfare organisation is to declare a PStat Cat in the same way as if they were a UK Civil Servant. The chosen option will be notified and can only be changed under the following circumstances:     a. On the occasion of substantive promotion, reversion or relinquishment of rank or grade of either spouse or civil partner.     b. When either spouse or civil partner leaves the Services, Civil Service or recognised welfare organisation.     3 Recognised welfare organisation – Council of Voluntary Welfare Workers (CVWW), Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), SSAFA and Defence Medical Welfare Service (DMHS) will carry the suffix ‘c’.     2 - 2 - 3 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     c. When either spouse or civil partner is assigned/posted to another position.     d. When a Servicewoman is on unpaid maternity leave.     Where a Service person categorised as PStat Cat 1c or 1s wishes to change their PStat Cat other than in these circumstances, casework is to be submitted to the DBS MIL PERS- MIL OPS PACCC.     Children Act 1989 – Parental Responsibility     02.0206. Children Act 1989. These regulations have been framed to meet the requirements of the Services, but against the background of the Children Act 1989, which lays down a general principle for the courts, namely that the child’s welfare shall be the paramount consideration when the court determines any question with respect to the upbringing or property of a child. It aims to have Court Orders made only when the court considers that doing so would be better than making no order at all.     02.0207. Parental Responsibility. Parental Responsibility means all the rights, duties, powers and responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child holds in relation to the child and their property. These rights and responsibilities of a parent are not set out in the Children Act 1989; these rights have been established through case law. Parents married at the time of the child’s birth both have parental responsibility for the child. Where the parents were not married, the mother automatically has parental responsibility for the child unless the child was born after 1 Dec 2003 and the father or civil partner has jointly registered the birth of the child: in such cases both parents have parental responsibility.

entitled to. He lives in the block on base during the work week but his home address where he lives with his is in
Preston 134 miles from unit. Is he entitled to anything like Home to Duty. Ive tried reading the JSP but I find it
confusing.","As the SP is living in the block in the week it would be GYH rather than HDT as this is for SP who travel to
and from there home address daily.
Please see the below criteria to be eligible for GYH:
You are eligible for GYH (T) if your QRes is more than 50 miles from your Duty Station. However,
where you have a family home or privately maintained property within 50 miles of your Duty
Station, but your duties or a travel to work time exceeding 90 minutes by all viable methods and
routes of travel preclude you from travelling daily from that property, authority to claim GYH (T)
may be exceptionally granted by the PACCC. Where this is the case you will be invited to upload
evidence.
Alternatively, you may be entitled to GYH (T) when the nature of your duties permits you to travel
to your QRes at weekends and normal stand down periods and such travel is undertaken.
To prove eligibility you must upload one document from both Group 1 and Group 2. If your QRes
is overseas, any 2 documents from either Group 1 or Group 2 are required. All evidence supplied
must be shown in the name of the SP, displaying the address for the QRes that GYH (T) is being
applied for.
Group One
Mortgage documents
Land Registry documents
Ground Rent
Tenancy Agreement
Licence to Occupy including full details of the property
Group Two
Council Tax bill for the current year (or overseas equivalent) for a property which is wholly
or partially owned by the Service Person, or is a property on which the Service Person is a
signatory on a tenancy agreement
Utility bill (gas, electric, water, telephone but not mobile phone) (to be dated within the last 4
months)
Buildings and/or contents insurance (for the current year)

Direct Debit or Giro bank evidence of payment of any of the Group Two documents above
(to be dated within the last 4 months)
You will also be required to upload a screenshot from Google maps, displaying the most direct
and shortest route between your Duty Station to Qualifying Residence (QRes).
If the SP is entitled please can you ask them to apply on the HR hub, they will need to ensure there RWA is
the address of the block on camp and there Perm home address is the home they would like to claim GYH to","I'd be happy to help you with that. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the AS2 is eligible for Home to Duty Travel (HDT) since his home address is 134 miles from the unit, which exceeds the 50-mile threshold. HDT is a contribution towards the cost of travel between his Residence at Work Address (RWA) and his home address.","['All expense claim entitlements, irrespective of whether they have been claimed using the on-line self-service Expenses Claim system or the manual alternative, will be paid direct to the Service person’s nominated bank account.

It will not be paid concurrently with LSA. 6 Yes provided period alongside is programmed to complete within 12 months. 7 Yes provided period alongside is programmed to complete within 12 months. 8 Yes provided in a displaced port for a period programmed to complete within 12 months and the unit has not had its Base Port formally changed to the displaced port. 9 Includes at sea, anchor or buoy, or in foreign ports or when nuclear propulsion staff are required to maintain sea watches alongside (LSA will however cease on the first day a claimant no longer meets the qualification criteria for the allowance).     7 - 2 - A - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     Chapter 7 Section 3 – Home to Duty Travel Amended/Updated     General     07.0301. Aim. The aim of Home to Duty Travel (HDT) is to contribute towards the costs incurred when eligible Service Personnel (SP) travel between either their Residence at Work Address (RWA) or Alternative Working Address (AWA) and their assigned Duty Station.     07.0302. Rationale. HDT is payable because SP are required to be mobile as a condition of service, have a continuous liability for duty and have limited choice over the location of their Duty Station.     07.0303. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). HDT is non- taxable under a concession agreed by MOD, HMRC and HM Treasury.     07.0304. Principles. Amended/Updated. The following principles apply to all HDT payments:     a. Maximum distance for daily HDT. Amended/Updated. The maximum one-way journey distance claimable for daily HDT is normally 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time by public transport between RWA and Duty Station. See paragraph 07.0345 for exceptions to this.     b. Maximum distance for HDT when not travelling daily. The maximum one- way journey distance claimable is 250 miles between AWA/RWA and Duty Station for SP who are undertaking formal Remote Working (RW)1. This is not applicable to SP undertaking different forms of Flexible Working2 who are assumed to be travelling daily between their RWA and Duty Station.     c. Mileage assessment. Amended/Updated. HDT mileage is assessed as the distance travelled by the most direct route by road as calculated by a recognised route planner such as Google maps3. See paragraph 07.0317 for route factors which may be considered.     d. HDT contribution limit. HDT provides a tax-free contribution towards the cost of travel, it is not full reimbursement of all costs.     e. Personal Contribution. Amended/Updated. All eligible SP must self-fund part of the cost of their travel to their Duty Station, this is known as a Personal Contribution (PC). See paragraph 07.0329 for more details.     f. Cost Effectiveness. HDT payments should be based on the most cost effective and practical route. This will normally be the most direct route between RWA or AWA and Duty Station.     1 see JSP 750 – Centrally Determined Conditions of Service     2 Variable Start and Finish Times (VSFT) and Compressed Working (CW).     3 The same route planner is to be used within a unit, as directed by their Chain of Command.     7 - 3 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     g. Season Tickets. Where a HDT journey includes use of public transport for either part or all the journey a season ticket should be considered where this is the most economical and practical means of completing the journey. Season tickets are valid for periods ranging from seven days to a year. The choice of the most cost effective season ticket depends upon the frequency of travel required by a SP’s authorised working pattern. Annex A provides further details about season tickets.     h. Multiple Journeys. Amended/Updated. Only one HDT return journey per day may be claimed except as detailed in paragraph 07.0342.     i. Inner London. For HDT purposes Inner London is defined as within a five mile radius of Charing Cross (the statue of King Charles I - WC2N 5DU).     j. Unit HR. References to “Unit HR” in this section refer to JPA professional HR users whether accessed in-person or online via regional hubs4.     Eligibility     07.0305. Eligible Personnel. The following SP are eligible to claim HDT:     a. ', 'FTRS(FC) personnel on selection for, and subsequent return from, an overseas assignment into a Regular JPAN are eligible.     1 This eligibility includes Service personnel who are currently transitioning to Phase 1 training in another Service or those Service personnel commissioning, or transferring to Non-Commissioned Aircrew terms of service, from the ranks.     12 - 1 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     c. FTRS (Limited Commitment) (FTRS(LC)), FTRS (Home Commitment) (FTRS(HC)), Additional Duties Commitment (ADC), Army Reserve Non Regular Permanent Service (NRPS) may be eligible and but only when they are invited to be assigned to a new duty station mid-contract, in the interests of the Service, and it is authorised by the DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0105. Ineligible Service Personnel.     a. SP joining their initial (Phase 1)2 training unit.     b. SP leaving the Services unless entitled to Final Tour of Duty (12.0112b), redundancy or being medically discharged (12.0112a).     c. SP assigned to the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) are ineligible for both their move to and from their EUMS assignment as they receive EU Daily Subsistence Allowance (EUDSA) (see Chapter 9 Section 10).     d. University Cadets, Medical or Dental Cadets and Foundation Year 1&2 Doctors, including re-designated deferred University Cadet Entrants (UCEs), are ineligible when in receipt of pay that includes an element for education grant.     Qualifying Criteria     12.0106. Qualifying Moves. It is the move of the SP, not the immediate family (except under circumstances in 12.0121, 12.0109 or 12.0108a), which provides eligibility for DE. To qualify for DE SP must:     a. Be ordered in writing to move to a new place of duty to undertake a permanent assignment following Phase 1 training1 or on subsequent qualifying moves (but see 12.0105); or     b. Be required to move from a RWA to temporary accommodation awaiting a further assignment (e.g. on an extended period of sickness). Where the subsequent assignment necessitates a further move to a RWA this will also attract DE; or     c. Undertake a mid-assignment move as detailed at 12.0117 or     d. Undertake a move in advance of an extended operational tour as detailed at Annex B to Section 1 of Chapter 2 para 1(j) and 12.0412(m).     For the purposes of Remote Working (RW), DE may be claimed by Service persons moving to or from an Alternative Work Address (AWA) when making a qualifying move on permanent assignment. SP will not be entitled to DE when making a mid-assignment move to an AWA unless ordered to in writing (See 12.0117). Where the SP’s AWA is separate to their RWA, DE may only be claimed from one of these.     2 This does not include Service personnel who are currently transitioning to Phase 1 training in another Service or those Service personnel commissioning, or transferring to Non-Commissioned Aircrew terms of service, from the ranks, who are eligible.     12 - 1 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     12.0107. Non-Qualifying Moves. Amended/Updated. The following moves are ineligible:     a. Where SP move between 2 Selected Places of Residence (SPR).     b. Where SP return from an assignment, where they occupied public accommodation, to a property that they previously lived in and which their family continued to occupy during their absence (e.g. those returning from SSSA to a home that has been continually occupied by their family, or single SP returning to privately owned or rented property that has not been let, or those returning to a home under Final Tour of Duty moves).     c. Where a couple move accommodation mid-assignment following their marriage/civil partnership, regardless of whether they have established a home prior to marriage/civil partnership.     d. Amended/Updated. When SP move into accommodation in a seagoing unit3.     e. When SP undertake operational tours.     f. Moves between SLA within the same Unit unless detailed in 12.0117.     g. When SP are in the final 6 months of their service. Where eligible, SP may be entitled to claim the Final Tour of Duty Allowance (See Chapter 12, Section 5).     12.0108. Qualifying Residences. To qualify for DE SP must be entitled to move at public expense and the move must be to or from a RWA. For remote working purposes, an AWA will also be considered a qualifying residence where the criteria in para 12.0106 are met.     a. If a SP elects to serve unaccompanied (UnAcc) and settle their immediate family in a SPR in the UK, DE may be claimed at the SFA or privately owned or rented accommodation Rate.     b. Where a SP assigned in the UK occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464 Part 1, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the SLA rate unless they are also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a).     c. Where a SP assigned overseas occupies SFA by virtue of their appointment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 2, paragraph 0302, DE will be paid at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate. If that SP is also eligible to claim DE at the appropriate SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate for a family move (see paragraph 12.0108a) only one DE claim may be made.     d. Where a SP successfully applies to occupy surplus SFA on assignment, in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, Chapter 9, DE will be paid at the SFA/SSFA/Privately Owned/Rented rate; this does not confer entitlement to any other relocation allowances unless mentioned within the specific chapters. The SP     3 A move to a seagoing unit where policy prevents SP from being accommodated onboard and therefore SP will be accommodated in SLA, is a qualifying move.     12 - 1 - 3 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     will not be eligible to claim further DE should they be required to vacate the surplus SFA in accordance with JSP 464, Part 1, paragraph 0905.     e.

Based on the information you provided, it seems that the AS2 is eligible for Disturbance Expenses (DE) and possibly other allowances. Since he lives in the block on base during the workweek but has a home address in Preston, 134 miles from the unit, he may be entitled to DE for travel between his duty station and his home address. To determine the exact entitlement, we would need to consider the AS2's circumstances in more detail. For instance, is he a regular service person or a reserve? Is he married or in a civil partnership? Does he have any dependents? Additionally, we would need to review the JSP 752 chapter 12, which outlines the rules for DE and other allowances. I would recommend consulting with the unit's HR admin staff or a personnel management officer to get a clearer understanding of the AS2's entitlements. They can provide guidance on the specific allowances and expenses the AS2 is eligible for, as well as assist with the claims process.","['Over Entitlement Costs.

Aim. When Service personnel are required to move RWA due to their Unit’s enforced relocation, the movement of Service families can be staggered up to 12 months preceding, or following, the expected date of the Unit move, through the granting of Early Mover Status (EMS). EMS helps to ease the burden placed upon DE and IPG to simultaneously move and find suitable accommodation for large numbers of Service personnel and their families, while affording families more time to make their own arrangements, such as schooling. EMS may also be granted to those assigned to join a Unit that is about to relocate within 12 months, allowing them to relocate directly to the new duty station in order to avoid the need for a double move. \n \n Eligibility \n \n 12.0802. Eligible Service Personnel. EMS only applies, and may only be awarded, to Service personnel in PStat Cat 1 and 2 who are moving to serve accompanied at a RWA (SFA or privately owned or rented families accommodation) at the new duty station. EMS relocations may then occur within 12 months of the expected Unit move date. Units are to ensure that individuals who will have less than 6 months to serve at the new location have the option to be relocated straight to their subsequent duty station elsewhere, or retain SFA at their current duty station, to avoid a double move wherever possible. \n \n 12.0803. Personnel Assigned to a Relocating Unit. EMS may be granted to eligible personnel who are assigned to join a Unit that is due to relocate, enabling them to move their family direct to a RWA at the intended new duty station in order to avoid a double move. Individuals also have the option to apply to retain SFA at their current duty station for up to 11 months before then moving to the new duty station, in accordance with JSP 464 Chapter 8. This is also to avoid a double move. \n \n 12.0804. SFA/SLA Considerations. For those intending to move into a new RWA that is SFA, EMS may only be granted when SFA is available at the new duty station location. EMS may also only be granted when SLA is available at the current duty station for the Service person to occupy after the family has relocated under EMS. \n \n 12.0805. Application Procedure. Following consultation with DE Ops Housing (or other housing provider if overseas) and IPG, Units are to apply, through their chain of command, to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC in accordance paragraph 04.0402, for authority to grant EMS to their Service personnel. A full and detailed justification is to be provided. Once PACCC have granted approval, Units must carefully prioritize the EMS relocations of their personnel, in close consultation with both DE Ops Housing and IPG, in order to achieve a gradual transition that matches available resources. \n \n Entitlement \n \n 12.0806. Relocation Package. Individuals granted written approval of EMS by their Units are then able to apply for SFA and the appropriate relocation package and Disturbance Expenses as defined in JSP 752 Chapter 12. \n \n 12 - 8 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n 12.0807.

Individuals who relocate their families to a different Theatre under EMS are to be treated as VOLSEP for the purpose of LSA, and are entitled to claim LSA at Level 1 in accordance with Chapter 10 Section 1. LSA may not be claimed simultaneously with GYH(T).', 'B. JSP 440 CT/CEx Policy Interim Supplement \n \n GENERAL \n \n Aim. \n \n 1. The aim of providing financial recompense and removals allowances for House Moves On Security Grounds is to contribute towards the necessary additional costs incurred by eligible Service Personnel when it is essential for them to move house on personal security grounds. No Service person should be financially disadvantaged as a result of being ordered to move house for security reasons. \n \n ELIGIBILITY \n \n 2. All Regular and Reserve Personnel who are subjected to a significant threat verified by civil police and security services are eligible to move house on security grounds. \n \n ENTITLEMENT \n \n 3. Any requirement for SP to move home on the recommendation of a civil police force because of a threat related to their employment with HM Forces is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. In accordance with Reference A, the SP will be entitled to Removals and Storage at Public Expense, Disturbance Expense (DE) and Refund of Legal Expenses (where appropriate); this is to be paid at the rate for SFA/SSFA. \n \n 4. Such SP may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred. CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff. \n \n Emergency Accommodation \n \n 5. If emergency accommodation is required, SP and any individual permanently residing with them will be temporarily accommodated in Service accommodation at public expense. If there is no Service accommodation available, SSSA, SSFA, welfare/contact houses or hotel accommodation may be used, also at public expense. \n \n Rehousing Location \n \n 6. In determining a suitable location for rehousing on a permanent or emergency basis, Defence Security will, in consultation with the relevant civil police, provide guidance on the suitabaility of proposed locations based on risk mitigation factors. Consideration should also be given to minimising the disruption to the SP and their family, particularly with regard to education and employment. However, the over-riding factor will always be the safety and security of the SP and their family. \n \n 12 - 4 - C - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n Annex C to Section 4 of Chapter 12 \n \n CLAIMS PROCEDURE \n \n 7. It is likely that any move for Security Reasons will be of a classified nature and therefore unit admin staff may be unsighted on any reasons leading to eligibility of claims. Any situation warranting a House Move for Security Reasons is to be brought to the attention of CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces who will subsequently provide a letter of authorisation to claim allowances. This letter is to be provided to unit admin to confirm eligibility for allowances, and may also be used as part of the application process for requesting Movement and Storage of Personnel Effects. \n \n 8. Claims for DE may be submitted 45 days prior to the expected move date. Service personnel are to claim using the JPA on-line self-service system. For those personnel with no access to the JPA on-line system, JPA Form F018 is to be submitted to unit HR admin staff. The unit HR admin staff will then check the claim prior to its authorisation by the unit Allowances Checker and input to the JPA system via an Element Entry. \n \n 9. Claims for Refund of Legal Expenses are to be submitted by Service personnel, with receipted invoices, the letter of authorisation and all supporting paperwork, on JPA Form F004 to their unit HR admin staff. The unit HR admin staff will ensure that all appropriate paperwork is included and then forward the claim to DBS for assessment, authorisation and payment. Payment of approved claims will be made through the Service person’s pay account up to the maximum threshold. \n \n 10. All other claims for any additional costs require authority from CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces. \n \n 12 - 4 - C - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)\u202f \n \n  \n \n Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n Chapter 12 Section 5 – Final Tour of Duty General \n \n 12.0501.

Aim. To enable the relocation and storage of the Personal Effects (PE) of Service Personnel (SP) and their immediate family members at public expense, within their entitlement, when assigned to a new qualifying duty station.     12.0402. Principles. The following should be applied when interpreting these regulations.     a. Removals and storage will be handled by the MOD contractor, unless stated otherwise.     b. Eligible SP will receive publicly funded removals and/or storage when permanently assigned to a new duty station or during an authorised Mid Assignment Move (see paragraph 12.0413).     c. Homeowners or householders have a maximum combined volume of 67.92 Cubic Metres (Cu M) for moving and/or storing their PE.     d. Relocation is not granted upon joining or rejoining the Services, except for FTRS personnel who immediately transfer to the regulars (see 12.0409d).     e. Relocation is only granted upon Termination of Service if SP meet the qualifications under 12.0416, 12.0417 or FTOD regulations (see Section 5 of this chapter). Relocation must be completed before the last day of Service, unless authorised by DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC prior to discharge. No authorisation can be given after personnel have left the Service.     f.

These regulations determine eligibility and methods for moving and storing PE and unaccompanied baggage. They should be read alongside Chapter 12 Section 1, Disturbance Expense, and JSP 800 Vol 2 Part 5. The Global Removals Management Service (GRMS) is responsible for coordinating and carrying out the movement and storage of PE and unaccompanied baggage through an appointed MOD contractor under Contract Management Authority.     12.0404. Relationship with MOD Contractor and Contractor Managers. SP should first direct any entitlement queries to their Unit HR, not the MOD contractor or contract managers. If Unit HR is unsure, they should escalate the query through the single Service Chain of Command or submit casework to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. Queries about the removals or storage process can be addressed through the MOD contractor\'s website or discussed with the contractor or contract managers once booked.     12.0405. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). Unless stated otherwise in paragraphs 12.0412-16, the methods of moving and storing PE are not subject to Income Tax according to ITEPA 2003 Section 271 to 287.

If there is no intent to move on assignment or for compassionate reasons and an additional move is requested after relocation to the new Duty Unit, this will be classed as a Mid-assignment Move.     4 The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense where there is a clear intent to move on assignment.     5 Para 3 of Annex B to Section 1 to Chapter 2 states ‘An important factor in the consideration of cases will be the permanence or expected duration of the impediment to mobility of the family.’ COs may wish to refer to Annex B to Section 1 to Chapter 2 when considering approval to extensions. 6 For example to enable the child to complete an academic term/year/key stage exam that moving immediately before could result in disadvantage     7 But only where SFA has been applied for immediately upon receipt of an assignment order. 8 Eligibility to a move at public expense will apply until the expiry of the authorised period of retention.

Moves must be undertaken within 6 months of reporting for duty at the new assignment, exceptions will only be considered in exceptional circumstances via casework submissions to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     (1) SP occupying privately owned RWA are not eligible for publicly funded relocations to an SPR, unless they qualify under FTOD rules or are assigned to a seagoing unit.     (2) The costs of relocating to a SPR must not exceed the cost of a move by the MOD contractor to the new duty station. If the cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0428).     (3) When occupying an SPR and moving on assignment to an RWA at a new duty station, the cost of the move will be limited to the cost of a move by the MOD contractor between the two duty stations. If the actual move cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0427).     (4) Moves from one SPR to another SPR will not be funded at public expense.     j. SP are required to change their RWA on temporary assignment or temporary unaccompanied assignment. If the new RWA is still within a reasonable traveling distance of the old duty station (see paragraph 12.0405), this is subject to tax liability.     k. If a SP is required by virtue of their rank or assignment to occupy tied SFA that is fully furnished and used for official duties, they can remove their entitled volume of PE to the tied SFA or store it at public expense. The combined quantity of PE removed and stored must not exceed the individual's entitlement. When the individual is required to vacate the tied SFA due to an assignment, the PE will be moved from the tied SFA or the storage location at public expense to either the previous SPR/RWA or a new SPR/RWA (but see 12.0412d (2) and (3)).     l. SP assigned on Loan Service are eligible unless the host nation's Loan Service Terms and Conditions of Service (LSTACOS) provide a separate provision for a move.     (1) SP assigned to the European Union Military Staff are entitled to removals at public expense using the MOD Contractor. They are then not entitled to claim the monthly allowance specified in Chapter 3, Article 16, Para 2 of the European External Action Service rules.     m. If a SP intends to marry or become a civil partner within 3 months of starting an overseas assignment and plans for their spouse or civil partner to join them within that timeframe, a move at public expense is allowed. If the marriage or civil partnership is delayed beyond 3 months or cancelled, the move will be treated as a mid-assignment move upon the first setting up of a home, and the SP may be required to repay shipment and/or storage costs.     12 - 4 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)            https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428         https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428         https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#ch7_0305Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     n.

SP who move under the Army over 37 provision (see Section 7 of this Chapter).     q. For the first move of family PE after the breakup of a marriage or civil partnership on change in PStat Cat, the volume of PE moved will remain within the authorised entitlement. The immediate family or Service Person are entitled to move their PE within the normal entitlement.

SP will not be liable for any tax as all tax liabilities for moving and storing PE are covered by the MOD and paid through DBS under a PAYE Settlement Agreement.     12.0406. Insurance. SP are strongly advised to obtain private insurance to ensure comprehensive coverage. When using the MOD GRMS removals and storage service, SP should be aware that all PE is moved at their own risk, and the insurance provided by the storage contractor will only meet minimum industry requirements which may not be sufficient. The MOD and its agents do not accept liability for any loss, damage, or delay to PE during movement or storage, except as listed in Chapter 17 Section 3, Disturbance Expense (DE). DE includes assistance for insurance costs during transit. SP ineligible for DE may be eligible to claim Insurance Allowance (see Section 2 of this Chapter).     12.0407.

complete, I’m now just looking in to the move itself. I have been looking through JSP 752 regarding movement
of personal effects but it isn’t clear how to actually go about organising the move. How do I arrange the
transfer of all my furniture etc into the SFA house? Also in terms of disturbance allowance, would I be eligible
and if so how do I claim?
This is my first time moving into SFA so not sure on the process, any help would be appreciated.","I have attached a link with regards to movement booking you can find this here: Agility GRMS
Would you like to go through a skype call on how to claim a disturbance expense?","To arrange the transfer of your personal effects into the SFA house, you will need to complete a ""Part A - Application and Acceptance of Conditions"" form, which can be found in Annex B to Section 4 of Chapter 12 of JSP 752. This form should be completed and submitted to your unit admin staff, who will then authorise the move and arrange for the contractor to undertake the move.

You will also need to ensure that you have packed your effects in accordance with the guidelines provided by the contractor, and that you have completed a ""Part B - Authority and Entitlement"" form, which will be used to calculate your entitlement to disturbance allowance.

Regarding disturbance allowance, you may be eligible if you are moving into SFA at RAF Valley and meet the eligibility criteria outlined in JSP 752. To claim disturbance allowance, you will need to submit a claim through the JPA on-line self-service system, which can be done up to 45 days prior to the expected move date.

It is recommended that you speak with your unit admin staff for further guidance on the process and to ensure that you have completed all necessary forms and documentation correctly.","[""Authorisation to retain SFA does not automatically entitle the SP to other expenses or allowances, except for MSPE and DE. Authorisation for other allowances must be in accordance with existing policy in this JSP.     h. If there is no intent to move on assignment or for compassionate reasons and an additional move is requested after relocation to the new Duty Unit, this will be classed as a Mid-assignment Move.     4 The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense where there is a clear intent to move on assignment.     5 Para 3 of Annex B to Section 1 to Chapter 2 states ‘An important factor in the consideration of cases will be the permanence or expected duration of the impediment to mobility of the family.’ COs may wish to refer to Annex B to Section 1 to Chapter 2 when considering approval to extensions. 6 For example to enable the child to complete an academic term/year/key stage exam that moving immediately before could result in disadvantage     7 But only where SFA has been applied for immediately upon receipt of an assignment order. 8 Eligibility to a move at public expense will apply until the expiry of the authorised period of retention.

The SP is accompanied and occupying SFA/SSFA in the UK and needs to move their family to an SPR in the UK due to a new assignment that requires a change of duty station. Moves must be undertaken within 6 months of reporting for duty at the new assignment, exceptions will only be considered in exceptional circumstances via casework submissions to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     (1) SP occupying privately owned RWA are not eligible for publicly funded relocations to an SPR, unless they qualify under FTOD rules or are assigned to a seagoing unit.     (2) The costs of relocating to a SPR must not exceed the cost of a move by the MOD contractor to the new duty station. If the cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0428).     (3) When occupying an SPR and moving on assignment to an RWA at a new duty station, the cost of the move will be limited to the cost of a move by the MOD contractor between the two duty stations. If the actual move cost exceeds the entitlement, a personal contribution will be required (see paragraph 12.0427).     (4) Moves from one SPR to another SPR will not be funded at public expense.     j. SP are required to change their RWA on temporary assignment or temporary unaccompanied assignment. If the new RWA is still within a reasonable traveling distance of the old duty station (see paragraph 12.0405), this is subject to tax liability.     k. If a SP is required by virtue of their rank or assignment to occupy tied SFA that is fully furnished and used for official duties, they can remove their entitled volume of PE to the tied SFA or store it at public expense. The combined quantity of PE removed and stored must not exceed the individual's entitlement. When the individual is required to vacate the tied SFA due to an assignment, the PE will be moved from the tied SFA or the storage location at public expense to either the previous SPR/RWA or a new SPR/RWA (but see 12.0412d (2) and (3)).     l. SP assigned on Loan Service are eligible unless the host nation's Loan Service Terms and Conditions of Service (LSTACOS) provide a separate provision for a move.     (1) SP assigned to the European Union Military Staff are entitled to removals at public expense using the MOD Contractor. They are then not entitled to claim the monthly allowance specified in Chapter 3, Article 16, Para 2 of the European External Action Service rules.     m. If a SP intends to marry or become a civil partner within 3 months of starting an overseas assignment and plans for their spouse or civil partner to join them within that timeframe, a move at public expense is allowed. If the marriage or civil partnership is delayed beyond 3 months or cancelled, the move will be treated as a mid-assignment move upon the first setting up of a home, and the SP may be required to repay shipment and/or storage costs.     12 - 4 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)            https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428         https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#Chap12_0428         https://modgovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elizabeth_mcfadyen480_mod_gov_uk/Documents/Role/People-AF%20Rem-Allces4/Handover/JSP%20752/Oct%2023/20231001-JSP%20752%20v56%20Oct%2023.docx#ch7_0305Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     n.

The aim of providing financial recompense and removals allowances for House Moves On Security Grounds is to contribute towards the necessary additional costs incurred by eligible Service Personnel when it is essential for them to move house on personal security grounds. No Service person should be financially disadvantaged as a result of being ordered to move house for security reasons.     ELIGIBILITY     2. All Regular and Reserve Personnel who are subjected to a significant threat verified by civil police and security services are eligible to move house on security grounds.     ENTITLEMENT     3. Any requirement for SP to move home on the recommendation of a civil police force because of a threat related to their employment with HM Forces is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. In accordance with Reference A, the SP will be entitled to Removals and Storage at Public Expense, Disturbance Expense (DE) and Refund of Legal Expenses (where appropriate); this is to be paid at the rate for SFA/SSFA.     4. Such SP may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred. CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff.     Emergency Accommodation     5. If emergency accommodation is required, SP and any individual permanently residing with them will be temporarily accommodated in Service accommodation at public expense. If there is no Service accommodation available, SSSA, SSFA, welfare/contact houses or hotel accommodation may be used, also at public expense.     Rehousing Location     6. In determining a suitable location for rehousing on a permanent or emergency basis, Defence Security will, in consultation with the relevant civil police, provide guidance on the suitabaility of proposed locations based on risk mitigation factors. Consideration should also be given to minimising the disruption to the SP and their family, particularly with regard to education and employment. However, the over-riding factor will always be the safety and security of the SP and their family.     12 - 4 - C - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     Annex C to Section 4 of Chapter 12     CLAIMS PROCEDURE     7. It is likely that any move for Security Reasons will be of a classified nature and therefore unit admin staff may be unsighted on any reasons leading to eligibility of claims. Any situation warranting a House Move for Security Reasons is to be brought to the attention of CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces who will subsequently provide a letter of authorisation to claim allowances. This letter is to be provided to unit admin to confirm eligibility for allowances, and may also be used as part of the application process for requesting Movement and Storage of Personnel Effects.     8. Claims for DE may be submitted 45 days prior to the expected move date. Service personnel are to claim using the JPA on-line self-service system. ', 'Child Element. The Child Element of DE contributes towards the additional costs5 faced by Service parents when their child(ren) are required to change school as a direct result of the SP being permanently assigned to a new duty station. SP entitled to DE may claim the Child Element for each child (as defined at 02.0110) who is receiving full-time education, which includes nursery school or technical college. The following conditions must also be met to be eligible to claim the Child Element of DE6 :     a. The SP must be recorded as PSTAT Cat 1 or 2 and have declared their children on JPA.     4 This includes the immediate issue of a Medical Pension on discharge.     5 Costs include buying new school uniform or clothing and associated items when moving a child from one school, or place of apprenticeship, to another.     6 For determination of entitlement in exceptional circumstances casework should be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.     12 - 1 - 5 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. The SP must be eligible for the SFA / SSSFA / Privately Owned/Rented rate of DE. SP claiming the SLA rate of DE will not ordinarily be eligible for the Child Element of DE.     c. Any nursery school or playgroup is to be established under formal arrangements with the Local Education Authority (LEA) or equivalent overseas.     12.0116. Delayed Moves. The aim of a delayed move is to retain eligibility for a move at public expense and DE where there is a clear intent to move on assignment. Delayed moves resulting in an entitlement to DE are as per paragraph 12.0412. SP who move into SLA on a temporary basis while arranging permanent accommodation may defer the payment of DE until they move into their selected permanent accommodation and therefore claim the appropriate rate (see paragraph 12.0114). DE may not be claimed for both moves. Delayed moves for any other reason may be authorised by DBS MIL PERS- MIL OPS PACCC.     12.0117. Mid-assignment Moves. The following rules apply for entitlement to DE on mid-assignment moves:     a. DE is payable for mid-assignment moves where a move of accommodation is directed by DIO, or equivalents, or for Service reasons7. Where there are compelling welfare, medical or compassionate reasons for a mid-assignment move approval should be sought from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The CO or authorising officer should stipulate whether the case requires urgent resolution or not.     b. Where the SP accommodation entitlement changes due to promotion or a change in the size of the immediate family (other than as a result of first setting up of home as per 12.0107c) the SP will normally be entitled to a mid-assignment move and therefore the associated level of DE. The SP must have an expectation of occupying the new property for at least 6 months.     c. Mid-assignment moves for other personal reasons, including on estrangement, and for operational deployments do not give an entitlement to DE.     d. Mid-assignment moves to or from an AWA do not give an entitlement to DE unless the SP has been ordered to in writing or the conditions in sub para a. above have been met.     12.0118. House Moves on Security Grounds. Any requirement for SP to move home as a result of a security threat, which has been verified by a Home Department Police Force, is to be treated as a move of house for Service reasons. Such SP are entitled to Disturbance Expenses, Refund of Legal Expenses and Movement and Storage of Personal Effects allowances and may additionally claim for any extraordinary expenditure incurred.     a. For Mainland UK moves, CDP(AF Rem) AHd Allces is responsible for authorising all claims, including any extraordinary expenditure, having consulted with single Service/TLB staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is at Chapter 12, Section 4.     7 Mid-Assignment Moves between SLA should be of a permanent nature i.e. for a minimum of a 6 month period as stated in Para 12.0114.     12 - 1 - 6 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     b. For Northern Ireland moves, Comd 38 (Irish) Brigade is responsible for authorising all claims, having consulted with CDP(AF Rem) staff. The process for submitting claims and details of eligibility is contained within 38 (Irish) Brigade Standing Instructions (NISO 119).     12.0119. Service Couples. Where a Service couple occupy the same private accommodation (owned or rented) or SFA/SSFA, only one individual is eligible to claim DE for that accommodation. This is normally the individual who is recognised as PStat Cat 1s.     12.0120. SP Sharing Private Accommodation. Where a SP entitled to DE moves into shared private accommodation with other SP, who are not their spouse or civil partner, the rate of the allowance payable will be as follows:     a. When sharing with one other SP, who is entitled to claim DE for the move, on occupying the accommodation half the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     b. When sharing with 2 or more other SP, who are entitled to claim DE, on occupying the accommodation one third of the appropriate rate is payable. When calculating this rate, the resultant sum is to be rounded up to the nearest whole pound.     12.0121. Families of Deceased SP. Following the death of a SP, their immediate family is entitled to DE for any move between Service accommodation and for their final move from Service accommodation into private accommodation.     12.0122. Evacuated Families. For entitlement to DE as a consequence of emergency evacuation from an overseas assignment, see Section 6 to this Chapter.     Rates     12.0123. Method of Rate Calculation. The rates are based upon the average additional expenditure incurred when SP are required to move into a RWA at a new duty station in the UK or overseas. MOD then determines the type of expenditure it will support (e.g. at present it will support the cost of providing new school uniforms; but it will not support the loss of income as a result of a spouse/civil partner or partner giving up their employment). The full list of items to which DE currently contributes is at Annex A to this Section.     12.0124. Publication of Rates of DE. The rates of DE will be published in the annual CDP Rem Directed Letter “Rates of Entitlement for Allowances for SP”. The current rates are also at Chapter 3 Section 1.     Method of Claim     12.0125. Method of Claim. Claims for DE may be submitted 45 days prior to the expected move date. Service personnel are to claim using the JPA on-line self-service system.

I can confirm on-assignment you will be able to claim for your meal receipts (not alcohol). The current ‘Day
Subsistence’ rate for meals in UK is £30.00 (per person, per day, for accompanying family. Maximum 3 days, or
4, if over a Sunday or Public Holiday). This is NOT a flat rate and receipted costs should be claimed. This rate is
the same for all family members.
Meal receipts should be claimed via JPA Self-service – JPA Expenses – create a claim – claim type ‘Change of
Assignment’ and expense type ‘Subsistence’ (Day Subsistence for meals & Night Subsistence for hotel
receipts).
Hotels must be Service-arranged via Travel Cell/GBT. The maximum is 3 nights (or 4 night, if over a Sunday or
public holiday).

Should you choose to stay with family or friends (excluding spouse or civil partner), instead of a hotel
(Day/Night Subsistence), you can claim PAR (Private Arrangements Rate Staying with Family & Friends) (JSP
752, para 05.0108(b)) . This is paid at the flat rate of £35.00 per day - please note this is a flat rate and
you cannot claim hotels or meals (Day Subsistence) for yourself and any accompanying family member
during the period of PAR.","For hotel stays, the subsistence allowance rates are as follows: 
The Night Subsistence (NS) rate is £35.00 per 24-hour period for adults. 
There is no specific child rate mentioned in the provided search results. 
It is assumed that the child rate would be the same as the adult rate, but it is recommended to verify this with the relevant authorities. When staying at a family member's house, you can claim Private Arrangements Rate (PAR) which is £35.00 per 24-hour period for adults.

For clarity, these additional subsistence are not payable in the following circumstances:     a. When purchasing a property for which there is no entitlement to claim a refund of legal expenses for that transaction.     b. When occupying temporary accommodation which is not within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of the new permanent assignment station.     c.

When living with relatives or friends whilst searching for accommodation. In this instance, PAR for 3 nights, or 4 nights if a Sunday or public holiday is included, is admissible.     05.0163. Service Families’ Accommodation Unavailable for 28 days or More. Where married Service personnel or those in a civil partnership are entitled to, and have applied for, SFA at their new permanent assignment station but have been informed that none is available for occupation within 28 days of joining for duty, the receiving unit can grant subsistence for up to a maximum of 11 nights UK (14 nights if overseas) providing it is necessary to stay within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of their new place of duty to look for privately rented accommodation, SSFA or a property to purchase. These additional nights subsistence are normally to be taken during periods of relocation inter- assignment leave.     05.0164. Subsistence on Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in the UK. Where Service personnel permanently assigned from the UK to an overseas duty station unavoidably incur hotel expenses (e.g. they are required to move out of their residence at duty station for Service reasons prior to their departure date) they are entitled to claim subsistence for up to 3 nights for themselves and their immediate accompanying family, or up to 4 nights when a Sunday or Public Holiday is included. This subsistence expenses entitlement is to be claimed for temporary overnight accommodation in the UK. There may also be an entitlement to further subsistence on arrival at the overseas duty station in accordance with paragraph 05.0168. Where the assignment is within the UK and SFA is unavailable on arrival at the new UK duty station there may be an entitlement to subsistence in accordance with paragraphs 05.0163 or 05.0166.     05.0165. Subsistence on Arrival at or Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in Northern Ireland. Where Service personnel, and where applicable their accompanying immediate family, unavoidably incur hotel expenses as a result of moving PE to/from a permanent assignment station in Northern Ireland, subsistence for temporary accommodation can be claimed up to the limit authorised in paragraph 05.0168. This entitlement only exists for the period when a delay in the occupation of the new RWA/SFA is incurred as a result of the timescales for delivery of PE using Service move arrangements.     05.0166.

The local CO (or delegated officer) has the authority to extend this period to a maximum of 28 nights on arrival if the continued occupation of hotel accommodation is unavoidable. Occupation of hotel accommodation beyond 28 nights requires authority from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC, unless there is no alternative accommodation and a DIO issued Non-Availability Certificate (NAC) is held, where the local CO may approve subsistence for the duration of the NAC for the Service Person only. Application for authority should be submitted as early as possible to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC to consider whether subsistence should continue. The application should give the reason for continued occupation of hotel accommodation and details of the family and anticipated costs involved.     05.0168. Subsistence on Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station Overseas. Where Service personnel unavoidably incur hotel expenses, for themselves and where applicable their accompanying immediate family, on departure from an overseas permanent assignment station following a requirement to move out of either public or overseas rented accommodation, subsistence can be claimed for a period of up to 6 nights. The local CO (or delegated officer) has the authority to extend this period to a maximum of 14 nights on departure if the continued occupation of hotel accommodation is unavoidable. Occupation of hotel accommodation beyond 14 nights requires authority from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC. The application should give the reason for continued occupation of hotel accommodation and details of the immediate family members and the anticipated costs involved.     Part Three     Payments & Advances     05.0169. General Guidance. Service personnel should note the following points when considering submitting claims for subsistence:     a. They are responsible for the accuracy of their claims and that, by submitting them, they will be confirming that expenditure was actually and necessarily incurred.     b. The submission of incorrect claims will normally lead to recovery of claims/sums paid and/or disciplinary action. It is a serious offence to make, or conspire in the making of, a false claim or to withhold any information relevant to a claim. Personnel should seek advice at the earliest opportunity from their line manager or unit HR admin staff if they are in doubt or experiencing difficulty in any aspect of completing their subsistence claim.     c.

According to the principles outlined in Chapter 5, you and your family are entitled to claim subsistence expenses for travel. Since two hotels have already been booked for you by the travel cell, you can claim subsistence expenses for the actual costs incurred, up to the authorized limits. The adult rate for subsistence expenses is based on the Night Subsistence (NS) rate, which varies depending on the location. You can claim the actual costs of the hotel stay, up to the authorized NS rate. For child rates, you can claim a proportion of the adult NS rate, depending on the child's age. The child rates are not explicitly stated in JSP 752, but you can refer to the relevant sections for guidance on claiming subsistence expenses for children. When staying at a family member's house, you can claim a Private Ration Allowance (PAR) rate, which is a daily allowance to cover the cost of meals and incidentals.

Aim. The aim of subsistence is to reimburse actual allowable subsistence expenditure within MOD limits. Subsistence expenses are defined as food, drink, necessary personal expenditure and temporary accommodation expenses incurred when travelling on duty. \n \n When pay and claim is used SP may apply for an advance of subsistence to avoid incurring significant short-term costs (see paragraph 05.0169). \n \n When claiming Subsistence, personnel are to use the ‘Subsistence Expense’ option on the JPA dropdown menu. \n \n 05.0102. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Sections 240 to 241 subsistence expenses are normally non-taxable. However all subsistence for family members within the UK and subsistence for Private Arrangements Rate (PAR) will attract a liability for both Income Tax and NICs. With the exception of PAR, the tax and NICs liability will be met by MOD and paid by DBS under PSA. The Tax and NICs liability for PAR will be an individual liability that is delivered via JPA processing. \n \n 05.0103. Section Contents. For ease, this Section is divided into 3 parts: Part One covers the types of subsistence expenses, eligibility, conditions and standing entitlements; Part Two covers subsistence entitlements on assignment; Part Three covers payments, advances, rates, method of claim, method of payment and audit arrangements. \n \n Part One \n \n 05.0104. Elements. Subsistence comprise 3 elements: \n \n a. Night Subsistence (NS) (paragraphs 05.0105 - 05.0109) which normally consists of overnight accommodation and breakfast. \n \n b. Day Subsistence (DS) (paragraphs 05.0110 - 05.0112). \n \n c. Incidental Expenses (IE) (paragraph 05.0114). \n \n Night Subsistence \n \n 05.0105. General. NS is paid for an overnight absence where there is no suitable Service accommodation provision. Suitability of any available Service accommodation is at the discretion of the hosting unit commander. The standard of available Service accommodation should be: \n \n a. No worse than that occupied on a regular basis by those of the same rank permanently assigned at the temporary duty station as the potential NS claimant, \n \n 5 - 1 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n or \n \n b. Transit accommodation suitable for short term occupation (up to 30 days) by Service personnel on temporary duty. \n \n The unit commander must always be content that the additional cost of NS can be justified. NS is the re-imbursement of actual expenditure, supported by receipts (paragraph 04.0303), up to NS limits (see paragraph 05.0108), for costs necessarily incurred for overnight accommodation, food and drink during absence on duty from the permanent or temporary assignment station. \n \n 05.0106. Inadmissible Journeys for NS. NS is not admissible for a night on which a journey is begun after, or terminated at the home or duty station before, 0300 hours. Nor is it admissible when Service personnel are required to travel overnight during the routine performance of their duties when there is no requirement for sleeping accommodation, regardless of when the journey starts or terminates. NS may not be claimed for commuting purposes when travelling from an Alternative Working Address (AWA) to the Service persons duty station. \n \n 05.0107. Documentation. A claim for NS must be supported (see paragraph 05.0173) by documentary evidence, as follows: \n \n a. A Non-Availability Certificate (NAC) indicating that suitable Service accommodation and/or messing is not available within 10 miles1 or 45 minutes travelling time (60 minutes for London) by public transport, or \n \n b. A letter from the hosting Service unit stating that there is no suitable Service accommodation available for the area of temporary duty (including where appropriate the reason why any available Service accommodation is deemed to be unsuitable), or \n \n c. Exemption from occupying Service accommodation granted under this Chapter (see paragraph 05.0120). \n \n 05.0108. Types of NS. The types of NS are: \n \n a. American Express (GBT) Booked Accommodation and Meals. American Express (GBT) provides Service personnel with hotel accommodation and some meals in the UK and overseas. Procedures for booking American Express (GBT) accommodation and meals are at Section 8 of this Chapter. The hotel tariff booked by American Express (GBT) and the breakdown available on the subsequent hotel bill will determine the subsistence which may be claimed as follows: \n \n (1) Where a Bed and Breakfast (B&B) booking is made by American Express (GBT), or if they are unable to provide a suitable hotel, the actual costs of the B&B tariff will be reimbursed, irrespective of MOD limits. Where entitled, DS may be claimed in addition to the NS, up to the set MOD DS limit, for the actual cost of lunch and/or dinner meals. \n \n 1 Due to ‘rounding’s’ the actual distance can be 10.4 miles. \n \n 5 - 1 - 2 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n (2) Where a “room only” booking is made by American Express (GBT), the actual cost of the “room only” tariff will be reimbursed, irrespective of MOD limits. Where entitled, DS may be claimed in addition to the NS, up to the set MOD DS limit, for the actual cost of breakfast and/or lunch and/or dinner meals. \n \n (3) American Express (GBT) also offer Dinner, Bed and Breakfast (D,B&B) tariff in some hotels. If D,B&B tariff is booked and the hotel provides an itemised bill for each element, actual dinner expenses may be claimed within the MOD DS limit. If lunch is also required, reimbursement of dinner and lunch may not exceed the MOD DS limit.', 'Where the party is of 4 or more, arrangements are, where possible, to be made under the collective conditions as set out at paragraph 05.0123. \n \n 5 - 1 - 14 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n 05.0152. Charges for Service Personnel in Civil Custody. Actual charges for food for Service personnel in civil custody may be paid to the civil authorities and reclaimed by the Escorting Officer or NCO in charge of an escort party. Actual expenditure, irrespective of MOD limits may be reimbursed. \n \n 05.0153. Travel in the UK for Families of Service Personnel Under Sentence in the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC). Where it is not possible for a visitor to a Service person under sentence in the MCTC to complete the return journey in one day, NS to cover the cost of overnight accommodation for one night will be admissible. Reimbursement to the visitor is limited to the NS conditions at paragraphs 05.0105-09. \n \n 05.0154. Escorts Fed and Accommodated by Civilian Police. Where escorts are fed and accommodated under civilian police arrangements actual expenditure on subsistence expenses may be reclaimed, irrespective of MOD limits. \n \n 05.0155. Personnel Temporarily Accommodated in Foreign Messes. Service personnel required to pay for accommodation and/or meals when temporarily accommodated in foreign messes may be reimbursed the actual cost up to the appropriate subsistence rate for the country where the Mess is located. \n \n 05.0156. Groups Accommodated in Foreign Messes. Where a large detachment of personnel are staying in foreign Messes one of the following may be applied: \n \n a. Personnel are reimbursed for actual accommodation and food expenses up to the appropriate NS and DS allowance rates for the country where the Mess is located. \n \n b. If there is a collective arrangement and the bill is centrally paid for the group, personnel are ineligible for personal NS or DS expenses. \n \n 05.0157. Personnel Evacuated from their Permanent Duty Station Overseas. Service personnel and/or their accompanying immediate families evacuated from overseas under the authority of the Head of Mission, but not as a result of personal choice, are eligible to claim NS and DS for initial accommodation arrangements in the UK, or other country to which they have been evacuated, for each member of the immediate family evacuated. These are payable for up to 30 days from arrival if no other suitable Service accommodation is available. Where the evacuated family chooses to stay temporarily with friends and family as an alternative to hotel accommodation NS at PAR may be paid for up to 90 days. \n \n Part Two \n \n Subsistence Entitlements on Assignment \n \n 05.0158. General. A Service person, and if applicable, their immediate family, will be eligible to receive subsistence for their journey when assigned, in writing, to a new permanent duty station, which requires a move of residence for Service reasons. However, any claim for NS must be supported by the gaining unit7, via the appropriate HR \n \n 7 Unit HR, being cognitive of Para 05.0107, are able to acknowledge the availability, or otherwise, of appropriate Service accommodation and authorise a claim accordingly. Service accommodation is taken to be SFA, SLA and Messes but not Contact Houses which have a wider welfare purpose. \n \n 5 - 1 - 15 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4 \n \n department. Where the immediate family are required to travel independently at public expense, they will be entitled to subsistence in their own right. Where the Service person travels alone, they will be eligible for concurrent DS and NS costs. Service personnel travelling in their own vehicle(s) to or from overseas assignments are not normally entitled to subsistence allowance except for those assigned to or from North West Europe8 (see Paragraph 06.0718) \n \n 05.0159. Journey to the First Permanent Assignment Station on First Joining the Services and on Termination of Full-Time Service. Personnel can claim DS for the journey within the UK to their first permanent assignment station and from their releasing unit to the selected place of residence within the UK as a result of their termination of full- time service where the duration of the journey necessitates expenditure on meals. Where, unusually, overnight accommodation is necessary (e.g. an early morning reporting time at the first duty station), NS may be admissible in addition to DS. Journeys to/from countries other than the UK only attract subsistence for the portion of the journey undertaken in the UK. There is no entitlement to subsistence for those who are already serving overseas who elect to retire overseas. \n \n 05.0160. Change of Permanent Assignment Station Within the UK for Personnel due to be Accommodated in Substitute Service Accommodation - Preliminary Viewing. Service personnel who are assigned to a new permanent assignment station within the UK and are in receipt of a NAC, are eligible for one night’s NS for themselves and, if they are viewing SSFA, their accompanying immediate family members, to facilitate their preliminary viewing and selection of new SSFA/SSSA accommodation. \n \n 05.0161. Change of Permanent Assignment Station From Overseas to the UK for Personnel due to be Accommodated in Substitute Service Accommodation - Preliminary Viewing. Service personnel who are assigned to a new permanent assignment station in the UK from overseas, and are in receipt of a NAC, are eligible for subsistence for up to 4 nights for themselves only, to facilitate their preliminary viewing of SSFA/SSSA and selection of new accommodation prior to their relocation to the UK. \n \n 05.0162. Service Families Accommodation9 Unavailable for Less Than 28 Days in the UK. Service personnel permanently assigned to a UK duty station where public accommodation has been allocated, but for administrative reasons is temporarily unavailable for occupation for up to 28 days, are entitled to claim subsistence10 for a period of up to 3 nights for themselves and their immediate accompanying family, or up to 4 nights when a Sunday or Public Holiday is included. This entitlement to subsistence may be utilised at the old or new UK permanent assignment station. If SFA cannot be made available after 3 nights (4 if a Sunday or Public Holiday is included), the Service person will be expected to occupy SLA until SFA becomes available. Subsistence will not be available to the immediate family beyond 3/4 nights. Where no SLA is available, subsistence may be paid for the Service person only, until SLA or SFA is available, subject to the 28-day maximum. A certificate is to be obtained from DIO, the relevant housing authority or the unit, to support a subsistence claim.', 'When purchasing a property for which there is no entitlement to claim a refund of legal expenses for that transaction. \n \n b. When occupying temporary accommodation which is not within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of the new permanent assignment station. \n \n c. When searching for accommodation, which is not within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of the new permanent assignment station. \n \n d. When living with relatives or friends whilst searching for accommodation. In this instance, PAR for 3 nights, or 4 nights if a Sunday or public holiday is included, is admissible. \n \n 05.0163. Service Families’ Accommodation Unavailable for 28 days or More. Where married Service personnel or those in a civil partnership are entitled to, and have applied for, SFA at their new permanent assignment station but have been informed that none is available for occupation within 28 days of joining for duty, the receiving unit can grant subsistence for up to a maximum of 11 nights UK (14 nights if overseas) providing it is necessary to stay within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of their new place of duty to look for privately rented accommodation, SSFA or a property to purchase. These additional nights subsistence are normally to be taken during periods of relocation inter- assignment leave. \n \n 05.0164. Subsistence on Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in the UK. Where Service personnel permanently assigned from the UK to an overseas duty station unavoidably incur hotel expenses (e.g. they are required to move out of their residence at duty station for Service reasons prior to their departure date) they are entitled to claim subsistence for up to 3 nights for themselves and their immediate accompanying family, or up to 4 nights when a Sunday or Public Holiday is included. This subsistence expenses entitlement is to be claimed for temporary overnight accommodation in the UK. There may also be an entitlement to further subsistence on arrival at the overseas duty station in accordance with paragraph 05.0168. Where the assignment is within the UK and SFA is unavailable on arrival at the new UK duty station there may be an entitlement to subsistence in accordance with paragraphs 05.0163 or 05.0166. \n \n 05.0165. Subsistence on Arrival at or Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in Northern Ireland. Where Service personnel, and where applicable their accompanying immediate family, unavoidably incur hotel expenses as a result of moving PE to/from a permanent assignment station in Northern Ireland, subsistence for temporary accommodation can be claimed up to the limit authorised in paragraph 05.0168. This entitlement only exists for the period when a delay in the occupation of the new RWA/SFA is incurred as a result of the timescales for delivery of PE using Service move arrangements. \n \n 05.0166.

Aim. The aim of subsistence is to reimburse actual allowable subsistence expenditure within MOD limits. Subsistence expenses are defined as food, drink, necessary personal expenditure and temporary accommodation expenses incurred when travelling on duty.     When pay and claim is used SP may apply for an advance of subsistence to avoid incurring significant short-term costs (see paragraph 05.0169).     When claiming Subsistence, personnel are to use the ‘Subsistence Expense’ option on the JPA dropdown menu.     05.0102. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Sections 240 to 241 subsistence expenses are normally non-taxable. However all subsistence for family members within the UK and subsistence for Private Arrangements Rate (PAR) will attract a liability for both Income Tax and NICs. With the exception of PAR, the tax and NICs liability will be met by MOD and paid by DBS under PSA. The Tax and NICs liability for PAR will be an individual liability that is delivered via JPA processing.     05.0103. Section Contents. For ease, this Section is divided into 3 parts: Part One covers the types of subsistence expenses, eligibility, conditions and standing entitlements; Part Two covers subsistence entitlements on assignment; Part Three covers payments, advances, rates, method of claim, method of payment and audit arrangements.     Part One     05.0104. Elements. Subsistence comprise 3 elements:     a. Night Subsistence (NS) (paragraphs 05.0105 - 05.0109) which normally consists of overnight accommodation and breakfast.     b. Day Subsistence (DS) (paragraphs 05.0110 - 05.0112).     c. Incidental Expenses (IE) (paragraph 05.0114).     Night Subsistence     05.0105. General. NS is paid for an overnight absence where there is no suitable Service accommodation provision. Suitability of any available Service accommodation is at the discretion of the hosting unit commander. The standard of available Service accommodation should be:     a. No worse than that occupied on a regular basis by those of the same rank permanently assigned at the temporary duty station as the potential NS claimant,     5 - 1 - 1 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     or     b. Transit accommodation suitable for short term occupation (up to 30 days) by Service personnel on temporary duty.     The unit commander must always be content that the additional cost of NS can be justified. NS is the re-imbursement of actual expenditure, supported by receipts (paragraph 04.0303), up to NS limits (see paragraph 05.0108), for costs necessarily incurred for overnight accommodation, food and drink during absence on duty from the permanent or temporary assignment station.     05.0106. Inadmissible Journeys for NS. NS is not admissible for a night on which a journey is begun after, or terminated at the home or duty station before, 0300 hours. Nor is it admissible when Service personnel are required to travel overnight during the routine performance of their duties when there is no requirement for sleeping accommodation, regardless of when the journey starts or terminates. NS may not be claimed for commuting purposes when travelling from an Alternative Working Address (AWA) to the Service persons duty station.     05.0107. Documentation. A claim for NS must be supported (see paragraph 05.0173) by documentary evidence, as follows:     a. A Non-Availability Certificate (NAC) indicating that suitable Service accommodation and/or messing is not available within 10 miles1 or 45 minutes travelling time (60 minutes for London) by public transport, or     b. A letter from the hosting Service unit stating that there is no suitable Service accommodation available for the area of temporary duty (including where appropriate the reason why any available Service accommodation is deemed to be unsuitable), or     c. Exemption from occupying Service accommodation granted under this Chapter (see paragraph 05.0120).     05.0108. Types of NS. The types of NS are:     a. American Express (GBT) Booked Accommodation and Meals. American Express (GBT) provides Service personnel with hotel accommodation and some meals in the UK and overseas. Procedures for booking American Express (GBT) accommodation and meals are at Section 8 of this Chapter. The hotel tariff booked by American Express (GBT) and the breakdown available on the subsequent hotel bill will determine the subsistence which may be claimed as follows:     (1) Where a Bed and Breakfast (B&B) booking is made by American Express (GBT), or if they are unable to provide a suitable hotel, the actual costs of the B&B tariff will be reimbursed, irrespective of MOD limits. ', 'A certificate is to be obtained from DIO, the relevant housing authority or the unit, to support a subsistence claim. Service personnel will not be entitled     8 For duty travel on assignment purposes, North West Europe is defined as Germany, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands 9 This would similarly provide support to SP intending to occupy private accommodation who encounter issues accessing their storage, thereby limiting the habitability of the private property; however this should be in consultation with the gaining unit HR, who must approve this eligibility based upon the circumstances.     10 This includes the use of contact/welfare houses, however if this type of accommodation is located close to messing or subsidised facilities no subsistence allowance is to be paid as these facilties are to be utilised.     5 - 1 - 16 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     to additional subsistence, above those allowed in this paragraph. For clarity, these additional subsistence are not payable in the following circumstances:     a. When purchasing a property for which there is no entitlement to claim a refund of legal expenses for that transaction.     b. When occupying temporary accommodation which is not within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of the new permanent assignment station.     c. When searching for accommodation, which is not within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of the new permanent assignment station.     d. When living with relatives or friends whilst searching for accommodation. In this instance, PAR for 3 nights, or 4 nights if a Sunday or public holiday is included, is admissible.     05.0163. Service Families’ Accommodation Unavailable for 28 days or More. Where married Service personnel or those in a civil partnership are entitled to, and have applied for, SFA at their new permanent assignment station but have been informed that none is available for occupation within 28 days of joining for duty, the receiving unit can grant subsistence for up to a maximum of 11 nights UK (14 nights if overseas) providing it is necessary to stay within 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time of their new place of duty to look for privately rented accommodation, SSFA or a property to purchase. These additional nights subsistence are normally to be taken during periods of relocation inter- assignment leave.     05.0164. Subsistence on Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in the UK. Where Service personnel permanently assigned from the UK to an overseas duty station unavoidably incur hotel expenses (e.g. they are required to move out of their residence at duty station for Service reasons prior to their departure date) they are entitled to claim subsistence for up to 3 nights for themselves and their immediate accompanying family, or up to 4 nights when a Sunday or Public Holiday is included. This subsistence expenses entitlement is to be claimed for temporary overnight accommodation in the UK. There may also be an entitlement to further subsistence on arrival at the overseas duty station in accordance with paragraph 05.0168. Where the assignment is within the UK and SFA is unavailable on arrival at the new UK duty station there may be an entitlement to subsistence in accordance with paragraphs 05.0163 or 05.0166.     05.0165. Subsistence on Arrival at or Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station in Northern Ireland. Where Service personnel, and where applicable their accompanying immediate family, unavoidably incur hotel expenses as a result of moving PE to/from a permanent assignment station in Northern Ireland, subsistence for temporary accommodation can be claimed up to the limit authorised in paragraph 05.0168. This entitlement only exists for the period when a delay in the occupation of the new RWA/SFA is incurred as a result of the timescales for delivery of PE using Service move arrangements.     05.0166. Overseas Pre-Assignment Recce Visits. Travel and subsistence entitlements are detailed at Chapter 6, Section 7, paragraphs 06.0709 to 06.0713.     05.0167. Subsistence on Arrival at a Permanent Assignment Station Overseas. Amended/Updated. From the official call-forward date, where Service personnel     5 - 1 - 17 JSP 752 (v59 Jul 24)Before advising on or making a claim read the Principles in Ch 1 and Responsibilities in Ch 4     unavoidably11 incur hotel expenses, for themselves and where applicable their accompanying immediate family, on arrival at an overseas permanent assignment station, (irrespective of the location of the previous assignment station), before moving into either public or overseas rented accommodation, subsistence may be claimed for a period of up to 14 nights on arrival. The local CO (or delegated officer) has the authority to extend this period to a maximum of 28 nights on arrival if the continued occupation of hotel accommodation is unavoidable. Occupation of hotel accommodation beyond 28 nights requires authority from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC, unless there is no alternative accommodation and a DIO issued Non-Availability Certificate (NAC) is held, where the local CO may approve subsistence for the duration of the NAC for the Service Person only. Application for authority should be submitted as early as possible to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC to consider whether subsistence should continue. The application should give the reason for continued occupation of hotel accommodation and details of the family and anticipated costs involved.     05.0168. Subsistence on Departure from a Permanent Assignment Station Overseas.

Aim. The aim of Get You Home Travel (GYH(T)) is to reduce the impact of separation on Service personnel (SP) in order to improve retention whilst also supporting the mobile nature of the Services. It achieves this by contributing towards the cost of travel1 from the Duty Station to a Qualifying Residence (QRes) when both are within the same country, and the SP carries out such travel.     07.0402. Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs). In accordance with ITEPA 2003 Section 296 GYH (T) is non-taxable.     Definitions     07.0403. Theatre Boundaries. Theatre boundaries are defined in Chapter 2 Section 1. The following areas are regarded as separate theatres for the purposes of GYH(T).     Great Britain Northern Ireland NWE Other Countries     In addition, approval has also been given to extend GYH (T) to those serving in Great Britain whose authorised QRes is in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland.     07.0404. Qualifying Residence. The QRes must normally be in the same country as the Duty Station. It is the main residence where the Service person would live, but for the exigencies of the Service, and to which they return (and are capable of returning) during weekends, stand-down periods and periods of leave on a regular basis and therefore incur the travelling expenses which GYH (T) is designed to contribute towards. The QRes for the purpose of GYH (T) must be one of the following:     a. The Family Home. (P Stat Cat 1/1s, 2 and 5s only). (Where the family home is in a different country to the Duty Station), PACCC casework is to be submitted. In this scenario, the family home must be within a bordering country, must be an address that has previously been used as an overseas RWA or GYH(T) QRes and be subject to the usual QRes definitions). Family homes in the UK do not qualify as GYH(T) QRes when the Duty Station is overseas.     b. Privately Maintained Property.     c.

Further restrictions on the use of a Privately Maintained Property are given at paragraph 07.0409.     Eligibility     07.0405. General. A guide to GYH(T) eligibility can be found at Annex C. All Service personnel other than those personnel specifically excluded under paragraph 07.0412 will be eligible to claim GYH (T), subject to meeting the following general criteria:     a. The QRes is more than 50 miles from the Service person’s Duty Station. However, where the Service person has a family home or privately maintained property within 50 miles of their Duty Station, but their duties or a travel to work time exceeding 90 minutes by all viable methods and routes of travel preclude them from travelling daily from that property, authority to claim GYH (T) may be exceptionally granted by the PACCC.     b. The nature of their duties permits them to travel to their QRes at weekends and normal stand down periods and such travel is undertaken.     c. Those claiming GYH (T) must provide current documentary evidence to prove entitlement2. The Service Person is to provide proof of financial commitment to the QRes supplying photocopies of the documents listed below, as follows; a Mortgage document, Land Registry document, Ground Rent or Tenancy Agreement of a QRes is mandatory in the UK, plus one of the documents from Group Two. For overseas properties, any two documents from Groups One or Two are required.     Group One     - Mortgage documents, Land Registry documents, Ground Rent, Tenancy Agreement or License to Occupy including full details of the property.     Group Two (either one, mandatory)     - Council Tax bill for the current year (or overseas equivalent) for a property which is wholly or partially owned by the Service Person, or is a property on which the Service Person is a signatory on a tenancy agreement, as detailed in paras 02.0137 and 07.0404 a-c     - Utility bill (gas, electric, water, telephone but not mobile phone) (to be dated within the last 4 months)     - Buildings and/or contents insurance (for the current year)     - Direct Debit or Giro bank evidence of payment of any of the Group Two documents above (to be dated within the last 4 months)     d.

Start of Entitlement. FIA is payable from the date of occupation of the qualifying accommodation or the first day of duty at a new permanent assignment station, whichever is the later.     05.0508. Cessation of Entitlement. FIA will cease to be paid from:     a. The day after the last day of duty at the permanent assignment station, or the day after permanent vacation of the accommodation, whichever is the earlier.     b. The first day of any temporary visits by a Service person’s immediate family that exceeds 28 days (aggregated or continuous) within a 61-day period.

The 11th day of a temporary absence (excluding annual leave) from the permanent assignment station that exceeds 10 days.     e. The first day of terminal leave. Where a Service person has no option but to continue occupying the accommodation during terminal leave that gave a previous entitlement to FIA, a case may be submitted to DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.

Casual Meal Charges. Service personnel in receipt of FIA are to pay the appropriate Casual Meal Charge for all meals taken in a Service messing facility. In Catering Retail & Leisure (CRL)/Pay As You Dine (PAYD) units the FIA recipient would pay for the food they consume.     e. Travel Costs.
